In addition, the offer contained in the ROFR Acceptance Notice need not replicate any financing terms of the ROFR Offer which provide for payment of consideration in a form other than cash, provided that consideration equivalent in value to the consideration proposed in the ROFR Offer is included in the ROFR Acceptance Notice.(c)The delivery of a ROFR Acceptance Notice by the Investor shall automatically, without any further action or documentation, give rise to a binding obligation to enter into an agreement between the Corporation and the Investor pursuant to which binding obligation the Corporation shall be legally bound to sell to the Investor, and the Investor shall be legally bound to purchase from the Corporation the Concentrate Interest on the terms set forth in the ROFR Acceptance Notice, subject only, if requested by the Corporation in writing within 10 days of receipt of the ROFR Acceptance Notice (an &#8220;Equivalency Determination Request&#8221;), to confirmation by an Independent Expert that the terms of the ROFR Offer and those contained in the ROFR Acceptance Notice (as modified by any subsequent agreement of the Parties) provide substantially equivalent benefits to the Corporation having regard to the financial, commercial and other relevant terms.(d)If an Equivalency Determination Request is delivered by the Corporation pursuant to Section&#160;6.3(c), the Parties shall select an Independent Expert in accordance with the procedures set out in Schedule C (the individual so selected being referred to as an &#8220;Independent Expert&#8221;)&#8203;-21-&#8203;to determine whether the benefits to the Corporation of the ROFR Offer and those contained in the ROFR Acceptance Notice (as modified by any subsequent agreement of the Parties) are substantially equivalent having regard to the financial, commercial and other relevant terms. The Independent Expert appointed pursuant to this Section&#160;6.3(d) shall render its determination in writing within 30 days of being retained and any such determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall, absent manifest error, not be subject to appeal. The Parties shall each pay one half of the costs and expenses associated with the retention of any and all Independent Expert retained pursuant to this Section&#160;6.3.(e)If: (i) the Investor does not accept the ROFR Offer within 45 days from the date of delivery to the Investor of the notice thereof; or (ii) if the Corporation has requested an Equivalency Determination Request and the Independent Expert determines that the terms contained in the ROFR Acceptance Notice are not substantially equivalent to the terms of the ROFR Offer and the Parties have negotiated in good faith to attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement for the sale of the Concentrate Interest to the Investor and have not entered into an agreement within 90 days of delivery of the ROFR Acceptance Notice, then the Corporation or such Affiliate shall be permitted to sell the Concentrate Interest to the applicable Third Party pursuant to terms and conditions contained in the ROFR Offer. Such sale must be completed within 60 days of the expiry of the 45-day period set forth in Section 6.3(a), failing which, the Corporation shall again be required to comply with the terms of this Section&#160;6.3 before selling the Concentrate Interest to a Third Party.6.4Limitation on Offerings: Standby Commitment(a)The Corporation covenants and agrees that it shall not undertake an Offering of Offered Securities prior to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date.(b)During the six month period commencing on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Corporation covenants and agrees that it shall not undertake any Offering of Offered Securities unless such Offering (a &#8220;Permitted Offering&#8221;) complies with the following requirements:(i)the Permitted Offering shall be an Offering of Common Shares;(ii)the aggregate gross proceeds from all Permitted Offerings shall not exceed US$10&#160;million during such six month period; and(iii)the Common Shares sold in such Permitted Offering shall be priced (the &#8220;Offer Price&#8221;) at no more than the Market Price of the Common Shares and no less than a 10% discount to the Market Price of the Common Shares, in each case calculated as of the date of public announcement of such Permitted Offering.(c)Subject to Section&#160;6.4(d), the Investor shall be entitled to exercise its Participation Right in connection with any Permitted Offering and covenants and agrees that, subject to the receipt of any required shareholder approvals, it will purchase any additional Common Shares offered in the Permitted Offering that are not sold to Third Parties at the Offer Price and otherwise on substantially the same terms and conditions as in the Permitted Offering (the &#8220;Standby Commitment&#8221;) (provided that, if the Investor is prohibited by Canadian Securities Laws or other&#8203;-22-&#8203;applicable law from participating on substantially the same terms and conditions of the Permitted Offering, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Investor to participate on terms and conditions that are as substantially similar as circumstances permit).(d)The Corporation shall deliver notice in writing to the Investor of any intention to utilize the Standby Commitment at least five Business Days but not more than ten Business Days prior to the closing of the Permitted Offering and in any event prior to the one year anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided that the Corporation shall be entitled to complete the sale of any Common Shares to be sold in the Permitted Offering to Third Parties no more than ten days prior to completing the sale to the Investor pursuant to the Standby Commitment and the Participation Right.ARTICLE&#160;7REGISTRATION RIGHTS7.1Demand Registration Rights(a)At any time the Investor may, provided that the Investor continues to hold at least 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, require the Corporation to file a Prospectus and take such other steps as may be necessary to facilitate a Distribution in Canada of all or any portion of the Registrable Securities held by the Investor (the &#8220;Demand Registration&#8221;). Any such request shall be made by a notice in writing (a &#8220;Request&#8221;) to the Corporation and shall specify the number and the class or classes of Registrable Securities to be sold (the &#8220;Designated Registrable Securities&#8221;) by the Investor, the intended method of disposition, whether such offer and sale shall be made by an underwritten public offering and the jurisdiction(s) in which the filing is to be effected. The Corporation shall, subject to applicable Canadian Securities Laws, use its commercially reasonable efforts to file one or more Prospectuses in compliance with applicable Canadian Securities Laws, in order to permit the Distribution in Canada of all of the Designated Registrable Securities of the Investor specified in a Request. The Parties shall cooperate in a timely manner in connection with such Distribution and the procedures in Schedule B shall apply.(b)The Corporation shall not be obliged to effect:(i)more than two Demand Registrations in any fiscal year of the Corporation provided that for purposes of this Section 7.1, a Demand Registration shall not be considered as having been effected until a Receipt has been issued by the Canadian Securities Authorities for the Prospectus pursuant to which the Designated Registrable Securities are to be sold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Demand Registration shall not be deemed to have been effected (and such Demand Registration shall not count as a Demand Registration) unless the Investor shall have sold at least 75% of the Designated Registrable Securities sought to be included in such Demand Registration;(ii)a Demand Registration in the event that it has received a prior request for a demand registration from an Offering Shareholder which has not been rejected by the Corporation and which offering has not yet closed; provided that this Section&#160;7.1(b)(ii) may only be relied on by the Corporation for a period of 90 days after receipt of the prior demand registration;&#8203;-23-&#8203;(iii)a Demand Registration in the event the Corporation determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with the Investor and its financial advisors, that (A) either (I) the effect of the filing of a Prospectus would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation because such action would materially interfere with a material acquisition, corporate reorganization or similar material transaction involving the Corporation; or (II) there exists at the time material non-public information relating to the Corporation the disclosure of which would be materially adverse to the Corporation (each of (I) and (II), a &#8220;Valid Business Reason&#8221;), and (B)&#160;that it is therefore in the best interests of the Corporation to defer the filing of a Prospectus at such time, in which case the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under this Section&#160;7.1 will be deferred for a period of not more than 90 days from the date of receipt of the Request of the Investor; provided, however, that (x) the Corporation shall give written notice to the Investor (I) of its determination to postpone filing of the Prospectus and, subject to compliance by the Corporation with Canadian Securities Laws, of the facts giving rise to the Valid Business Reason and (II)&#160;of the time at which it determines that the Valid Business Reason no longer exists and (y)&#160;the Corporation shall not qualify any securities offered by the Corporation for its own account during such period; or(iv)an underwritten Demand Registration in respect of a number of Registrable Securities that is expected to result in gross sale proceeds of less than US$10 million.(c)In the case of an underwritten public offering of Registrable Securities initiated pursuant to this Section&#160;7.1, the Investor shall have the right to select the lead underwriter(s) or lead agent(s) and the counsel retained which will perform such offering, provided, however, that the Investor&#8217;s selection will be subject to the approval of the Corporation, acting reasonably, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.(d)If at any time the Investor requests a Demand Registration, the Corporation shall have the right, within ten days (except in the case of a &#8220;bought deal&#8221; in which case the Corporation shall have only 24 hours) of receipt of such request, to notify the Investor of its intention to Register for distribution to the public under such Prospectus (i) an offering of Common Shares from treasury or (ii) securities of the same class as the Designated Registrable Securities owned by Shareholders (the &#8220;Shareholder Securities&#8221;) with piggy back registration rights (the &#8220;Offering Shareholders&#8221;) (such as the right of Paulson pursuant to section&#160;5.2 of the Paulson Investor Rights Agreement). The Investor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to include in the proposed distribution such number of Common Shares and Shareholder Securities as the Corporation shall request, upon the same terms (including the method of distribution) as such Demand Registration, subject to any Underwriter Cutback.7.2Piggyback RegistrationsEach time the Corporation elects to proceed with the preparation and filing of a Prospectus under Canadian Securities Laws in connection with a proposed Distribution of any of its securities, whether by the Corporation or any Offering Shareholder, the Corporation shall give written notice thereof to the Investor as soon as practicable. In such event, the Investor shall be&#8203;-24-&#8203;entitled, by notice in writing given to the Corporation (a &#8220;Piggyback Registration Notice&#8221;) within ten days (except in the case of a &#8220;bought deal&#8221; in which case the Investor shall have only 24&#160;hours) after the receipt of any such notice by the Investor, to require that the Corporation cause any or all of the Registrable Securities (the &#8220;Piggyback Registrable Securities&#8221;) held by the Investor to be included in such Prospectus (such qualification being hereinafter referred to as a &#8220;Piggyback Registration&#8221;), subject to any Underwriter Cutback. Any Distribution in respect of which there is a Piggyback Registration shall proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Schedule B. Notwithstanding the foregoing:(a)the Corporation may at any time, and without the consent of the Investor, abandon the proposed offering in which the Investor has delivered a Piggyback Registration Notice provided that the Corporation will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with such abandoned offering; and(b)if the proposed Registration is not completed within 180 days of a Piggyback Registration Notice, the Piggyback Registration Notice delivered by the Investor hereunder shall be deemed to be withdrawn and the Corporation shall again be required to comply with the procedures set out in this Section 7.2 with respect to any proposed Registration.7.3Underwriter CutbackIn connection with any exercise of the Demand Registration Right or Piggyback Registration Right, if the lead underwriter or lead agent for the offering determines in its good faith opinion that the inclusion of all of the Demand Registrable Securities, Piggyback Securities, Common Shares and/or Shareholder Securities proposed to be included in such offering may materially and adversely affect the price or success of the offering, then the amount of securities of the Corporation included in the offering will be prioritized in such offering, as follows (the &#8220;Underwriter Cutback&#8221;), but only to the extent necessary:(a)in connection with any Demand Registration: (i) first, to the Investor; (ii)&#160;second, to Paulson; and (iii)&#160;third, to the Corporation; and(b)in connection with any Piggyback Registration;(i)initiated by Paulson upon exercise of any demand registration right held by it pursuant to section&#160;5.1 of the Paulson Investor Rights Agreement: (A)&#160;first, to Paulson; (B) second, to the Investor; and (C) third, to the Corporation; and(ii)initiated by the Corporation: (A) first, to the Corporation; (B)&#160;second, to Paulson; and (C) third, to the Investor.7.4ExpensesSubject to Section 7.2(a), all Registration Expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with this Article 7 by the Parties shall be borne by the Corporation, other than the following Registration Expenses, which shall be borne by the Investor:&#8203;-25-&#8203;(a)any and all commissions payable to any underwriter for an underwritten offering or agent for an agency offering that are attributable to the Registrable Securities to be sold by the Investor pursuant to any Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration;(b)in the case of a Demand Registration, the Investor&#8217;s pro rata share of the Registration Expenses attributable to the offering based on the number of Registrable Securities to be sold by the Investor pursuant to such Demand Registration; and(c)in the case of a Piggyback Registration, any and all fees, disbursements and expenses of legal counsel or other advisors retained by the Investor in connection with such Piggy Back Registration.7.5Other SalesAfter receipt by the Corporation of a Request, the Corporation shall not, without the prior written consent of the Investor, authorize, issue or sell any Common Shares or Equity Securities in any jurisdiction or agree to do so or publically announce any intention to do so (except for securities issued pursuant to any legal or contractual obligations in effect on the date of the Request or pursuant to any stock option plan or equity incentive plan) until the date which is 90 days after the later of (a) the date on which a Receipt is issued for the Prospectus filed in connection with such Demand Registration, and (b) the completion of the offering contemplated by the Demand Registration.7.6Future Registration RightsThe Corporation shall not grant registration rights without the prior written consent of the Investor unless the granting of such registration rights does not limit, in any material respect, the registration rights granted to the Investor pursuant to this Agreement and such registration rights are not materially more favorable to the grantee than the registration rights granted to the Investor.7.7Preparation; Reasonable InvestigationIn connection with the preparation and filing of any Prospectus as herein contemplated, the Corporation shall give the Investor, its underwriters for an underwritten offering or agents for an agency offering, and their respective counsel, auditors and other representatives, the opportunity to participate in the preparation of such documents and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and shall insert therein such material furnished to the Corporation in writing, which in the reasonable judgment of the Investor and its counsel should be included. The Corporation shall give the Investor and the underwriters or agents such reasonable and customary access to the books and records of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and such reasonable and customary opportunities to discuss the business of the Corporation with its officers and auditors as shall be necessary in the reasonable opinion of the Investor, such underwriters or agents and their respective counsel. The Corporation shall cooperate with the Investor and its underwriters or agents in the conduct of all reasonable and customary due diligence which the Investor, such underwriters or agents and their respective counsel may reasonably require in order to conduct a reasonable investigation for purposes of establishing a due diligence defence as&#8203;-26-&#8203;contemplated by Canadian Securities Laws and in order to enable such underwriters or agents to execute the certificate required to be executed by them for inclusion in each such document.7.8Underwriting or Agency Agreements(a)If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering or by the agents for any agency offering by the Investor pursuant to the exercise of a Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration, the Corporation will enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters or agency agreement with such agents for such offering, such agreement to be satisfactory in substance and form to each of the Investor and the Corporation and the underwriters or agents, each acting reasonably, and to contain such representations and warranties by the Corporation and such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of these types. The Investor shall be a party to such underwriting agreement or agency agreement and may, at its option, require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Corporation to and for the benefit of such underwriters or agents shall also be made to and for the benefit of the Investor and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters or agents under such underwriting agreement or agency agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of the Investor. The Investor shall not be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Corporation or the underwriters&#8217; or agents&#8217; other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding the Investor and the Corporation&#8217;s intended method of distribution and any other representation required by law or as are generally prevailing in such underwriting or agency agreements for secondary offerings, as the case may be.(b)The underwriting agreement or agency agreement, as applicable, referred to in Section&#160;7.8(a) will contain customary terms, including an indemnity whereby in the event of the filing of a Prospectus, the Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless the Investor and each underwriter or agent involved in the distribution of Registerable Securities thereunder, and each of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, shareholders and limited partners against any losses, claims, expenses, damages or liabilities (including reasonable counsels&#8217; fees and all amounts paid in settlement of any investigation, order, litigation, proceeding or claim) (&#8220;Losses&#8221;), joint or several, to which the Investor, or such underwriter or agent or any of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, shareholders or limited partners may become subject, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof), arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereof, including in the documents incorporated therein by reference, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the Corporation will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Losses arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by the Investor, such underwriter or agent.(c)The Investor will indemnify and hold harmless the Corporation, its directors, officers, employees and agents to the same extent as the indemnity referred to in Section&#160;7.8(b), but only with respect to information regarding the Investor furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Investor to the Corporation expressly for inclusion in any Prospectus. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Investor&#8217;s obligations under the indemnity set out&#8203;-27-&#8203;in this Section&#160;7.8(c) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the net proceeds of the offering received by the Investor pursuant to such offering.(d)If reasonably requested by the underwriters or agents in connection with any underwritten offering or agency offering made pursuant to the exercise of a Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration, the Corporation shall cooperate with all reasonable requests made by the lead underwriter of such underwritten offering or lead agent of such agency offering respecting the attendance of the Corporation at road shows and participation of the Corporation in any efforts relating to the distribution and sale of the Designated Registrable Securities and Piggyback Registrable Securities, as the case may be.ARTICLE&#160;8STANDSTILL AND VOTING8.1Standstill(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 8.1, for a period of three years following the date hereof, neither the Investor nor any of its Affiliates will, without the prior approval of the Corporation:(i)acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, individually or acting jointly or in concert with any other Person (as determined in accordance with Section&#160;1.9 of NI&#160;62-104, hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Acting Jointly or in Concert&#8221;), any voting securities of the Corporation and/or Convertible Securities (a &#8220;Share Transaction&#8221;) if such Share Transaction would result in the Investor and its Affiliates having, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of, or control or direction over, more than 19.9% of an outstanding class of voting securities of the Corporation (calculated in accordance with Section&#160;1.8 of NI 62-104); for greater certainty, in the event that the Investor completes the Specified Securityholder Transaction or acquires Common Shares pursuant to the Standby Commitment, the 19.9% in this Section&#160;8.1(a)(i) shall be deemed to be increased so as to be equal to the percent of ownership of outstanding Common Shares upon completion of the Specified Securityholder Transaction and/or issuance pursuant to the Standby Commitment, as applicable;(ii)directly or indirectly, make, or in any way participate in, any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any other Person (other than an Affiliate of the Investor) with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Corporation;

acquisition of the securities of a Person or company which acquired the securities of the Corporation without the Investor&#8217;s solicitation or breach of this Agreement; provided that the purpose of such acquisition is not to circumvent the provisions of this Section&#160;8.1.(e)Notwithstanding anything in this Section&#160;8.1, the Investor shall be permitted at any time to make a confidential proposal to the Board regarding any of the transactions or activities contemplated in Section&#160;8.1(a), to enter into discussions or negotiations with the Board with respect&#8203;-29-&#8203;to the terms of any such transactions or activities and to enter into any agreement with the Corporation providing for or relating to the consummation of any such transactions or activities.(f)If, as a result of a Specified Securityholder Transaction, the Investor (together with its Affiliates) has, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of, or control or direction over, more than 40% but less than 100% of the outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation (calculated in accordance with Section 1.8 of NI 62-104) (a &#8220;Triggering Ownership Percentage&#8221;), the Investor agrees that it will not undertake any further Share Transaction except: (i) with the prior approval of the Independent directors on the Board; (ii)&#160;by way of a bona fide take-over bid made by the Investor or one of its Affiliates to acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation, other than those Common Shares beneficially owned, or over which control or direction is exercised, by the Investor or any Person Acting Jointly or in Concert with the Investor; or (iii)&#160;by way of a negotiated transaction approved by the Independent directors on the Board, including a merger, amalgamation, arrangement or similar transaction, and, in each case, otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this Section&#160;8.1.(g)For greater certainty, the provisions of this Section&#160;8.1 supersede the provisions contained in Section&#160;8 of the Confidentiality Agreement.8.2VotingAt any meeting of Shareholders, the Investor may vote or abstain or withhold from voting its Treasury Shares in any manner it wishes. For a period of three&#160;years following the date hereof, the Investor agrees that, in respect of any voting securities of the Corporation that it owns or over which it exercises control or direction other than the Treasury Shares (the &#8220;Acquired Voting Securities&#8221;), it will not vote or cause to be voted such Acquired Voting Securities against any resolution that a majority of the Board has approved to be recommended to securityholders of the Corporation as set forth in the management information circular sent to securityholders of the Corporation in respect of such meeting and which resolution has been supported by more than 50% of the securityholders voting on such matter (excluding the Investor).ARTICLE&#160;9MISCELLANEOUS9.1TerminationThis Agreement shall terminate and all rights and obligations hereunder shall cease immediately at such time as the Investor ceases to hold at least 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares.9.2Governing Law; Specific Performance(a)This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws applicable therein.(b)Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (ii) waives any objection that it might otherwise be entitled to assert to the jurisdiction&#8203;-30-&#8203;of such courts and (iii) agrees not to assert that such courts are not a convenient forum for the determination of any such action or proceeding.(c)It is agreed and understood that monetary damages would not adequately compensate an injured Party for the breach of this Agreement by any Party, that this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable, and that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary or permanent injunction or restraining order, without bond.

There are no covenants, promises, warranties, representations, conditions or other agreements, whether oral or written, pre-contractual or otherwise, express, implied or collateral, between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.ARTICLE&#160;2OBLIGATIONS2.1Obligations of the Corporation(a)General Indemnity - The Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Party harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, including but not limited to the indemnity under the Act, under the Notice of Articles and Articles of the Corporation and this Agreement, except to the extent limited or prohibited by the Act, from and against any and all Losses which the Indemnified Party may reasonably suffer, sustain, incur or be required to pay in respect of any Claim, provided that the indemnity provided for in this Section 2.1(a) will only be available if:(i)the Indemnified Party was acting honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Corporation or Other Entity, as the case may be, in relation to the subject matter of the Claim; and(ii)in the case of a proceeding that is not a civil action/proceeding, the Indemnified Party had reasonable grounds for believing that the Indemnified Party&#8217;s conduct in respect of which the action/proceeding was brought was lawful.(b)Derivative Claims and Claims by the Corporation - In respect of any proceeding by or on behalf of the Corporation or Other Entity to procure a judgment in its favour against the Indemnified Party, in respect of which the Indemnified Party is made a party by reason of the Indemnified Party being or having been a director and/or officer of the Corporation or Other Entity, the Indemnified Party may make an application, on its own behalf, or on behalf of the Corporation, at its expense, for the approval of a Court to advance monies to the Indemnified Party for costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such action&#8203;-4-&#8203;and to indemnify and save harmless the Indemnified Party for such costs, charges and expenses of such action provided the Indemnified Party fulfils the conditions set out in Sections 2.1(a)(i) and 2.1(a)(ii) above and provided that such advance or indemnification is not prohibited under any applicable statute. The Indemnified Party hereby agrees to repay such funds advanced if the Indemnified Party ultimately does not fulfil the conditions set out in Sections 2.1(a)(i) and 2.1(a)(ii) above. In the event that the Indemnified Party is successful in its application, it shall be reimbursed by the Corporation for the expense incurred by the Indemnified Party in making the application.(c)Advance of Expenses - Subject to Section 2.1(b) of this Agreement, the Corporation shall, at the request of the Indemnified Party, advance to the Indemnified Party sufficient funds, or arrange to pay on behalf of or reimburse the Indemnified Party within 60 days of receiving an invoice in respect thereof for any costs, charges or expenses, including legal or other fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in investigating, defending, appealing, preparing for, providing evidence in or instructing and receiving the advice of the Indemnified Party&#8217;s counsel or other professional advisors in regard to any Claim or other matter for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled to an indemnity or reimbursement under this Agreement, and such amounts shall be treated as a non-interest bearing advance or loan to the Indemnified Party. In the event it is ultimately determined by a Court in a final non-appealable judgment that the Indemnified Party did not fulfil the conditions set out in Sections&#160;2.1(a)(i) and 2.1(a)(ii) above; that the payment(s) is/are prohibited under the Act; or that the Indemnified Party was not entitled to be fully so indemnified, the Indemnified Party shall (and hereby agrees to) repay such loan or advance, or the appropriate portion thereof, upon written notice of such determination being given by the Corporation to the Indemnified Party detailing the basis for such determination and such loan or advance shall bear interest from the date of such notice until repaid at the prime rate prescribed from time to time by the Corporation&#8217;s principal bankers. The Corporation will have the burden of establishing that any expense it wishes to challenge is not reasonable. The Corporation shall not make any payments referred to in this Subsection 2.1(c) unless the Corporation first receives from the Indemnified Party a written undertaking that, if it is ultimately determined that the payment of expenses is prohibited by the Act or this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will repay the amounts advanced or reimbursed.2.2Notice of ProceedingsThe Indemnified Party shall give notice in writing to the Corporation as soon as practicable upon being served with any statement of claim, writ, notice of motion, indictment, subpoena, investigation order or other document commencing, threatening or continuing any Claim involving the Corporation or Other Entity or the Indemnified Party which may result in a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, and the Corporation agrees to give the Indemnified Party notice in writing as soon as practicable upon it or any Other Entity being served with any statement of claim, writ, notice of motion, indictment,&#8203;-5-&#8203;subpoena, investigation order or other document commencing or continuing any Claim involving the Indemnified Party. Such notice shall include a description of the Claim, a summary of the facts giving rise to the Claim and, if possible, an estimate of any potential liability arising under the Claim. Failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify the Corporation of any Claim shall not relieve the Corporation from liability under this Agreement except to the extent that the failure materially prejudices the Corporation.2.3SubrogationPromptly after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party of any Claim (other than a Claim by or on behalf of the Corporation or Other Entity to procure a judgment in its favour against the Indemnified Party), the Corporation may by notice in writing to the Indemnified Party, in a timely manner assume conduct of the defence thereof and retain counsel on behalf of the Indemnified Party who is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to represent the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim. On delivery of such notice by the Corporation, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement for any fees and disbursements of counsel the Indemnified Party may subsequently incur with respect to the same matter. In the event the Corporation assumes conduct of the defence on behalf of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party consents to the conduct thereof and of any action taken by the Corporation, in good faith, in connection therewith, and the Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate in such defence including, without limitation, the provision of documents, attending examinations for discovery, making affidavits, meeting with counsel, testifying and divulging to the Corporation all information reasonably required to defend or prosecute the Claim.2.4Separate CounselIf the Indemnified Party is named as a party or a witness to any Claim, or the Indemnified Party is questioned or any of his or her actions, omission or activities are in any way investigated, reviewed, or examined in connection with or in anticipation of any actual or potential Claims, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to retain independent legal counsel at the Corporation&#8217;s expense (limited to reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees and expenses) to act on the Indemnified Party&#8217;s behalf to provide an initial assessment to the Indemnified Party of the appropriate course of action for the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will be entitled to continued representation by independent counsel at the Corporation&#8217;s expense (limited to reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees and expenses) beyond the initial assessment if:(a)the Indemnified Party and the Corporation have mutually agreed to the retention of such other counsel;(b)representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them (including the availability of different defences); or(c)the Corporation has not retained reasonably satisfactory counsel for the Indemnified Party within ten Business Days of any receipt of notice pursuant to Section 2.2 above.&#8203;-6-&#8203;2.5Settlement of ClaimNo admission of liability with respect to the Indemnified Party shall be made by the Corporation without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such settlement includes an unconditional general release of the Indemnified Party without any admission of negligence, misconduct, liability or responsibility by the Indemnified Party.2.6Presumptions / Knowledge(a)For purposes of any determination hereunder, the Indemnified Party will be deemed, subject to compelling evidence to the contrary, to have acted in good faith and in the best interests of the Corporation (or any Other Entity). The Corporation will have the burden of establishing otherwise.(b)Unless a Court otherwise has held or decided that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be fully or partially indemnified under this Agreement, the determination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create any presumption for the purposes of this Agreement that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnity under this Agreement.(c)The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Corporation or any Subsidiary or Other Entity will not be imputed to the Indemnified Party for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.ARTICLE&#160;3INSURANCE3.1Insurance(a)The Policy - The Corporation will ensure that its liabilities under this Agreement, and the potential liabilities of the Indemnified Party that are subject to indemnification by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, are at all times supported by the Policy. The Corporation shall pay all premiums payable under the Policy and, provided that such insurance is, in the Corporation&#8217;s reasonable and good faith opinion, available on commercially reasonable terms, take all steps necessary to maintain the coverage provided under the Policy. As may be required by the Policy, the Corporation will immediately notify the Policy&#8217;s insurers of any occurrences or situations that could potentially trigger a claim under the Policy and will promptly advise the Indemnified Party that the insurers have been notified of the potential claim. If, for any reason whatsoever, any directors&#8217;, and officers&#8217; liability insurer asserts that the Indemnified Party is subject to a deductible under any existing or future directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation for the benefit of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party&#8217;s heirs and legal representatives, the Corporation shall pay the deductible for and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. If any payments made by an insurer under a Policy are deemed to constitute a taxable benefit or otherwise become subject to any tax payable by the Indemnified Party, the Corporation agrees to pay any amount as may be necessary to ensure that the amount received by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party after the payment of, or&#8203;-7-&#8203;withholding for, such tax, fully reimburses the Indemnified Party for the actual cost, expense or liability incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party.(b)Variation of Policies - So long as the Indemnified Party is a director, officer or holder of a similar office of the Corporation or an Other Entity and provided that such insurance is, in the Corporation&#8217;s reasonable and good faith opinion, available on commercially reasonable terms, the Corporation shall not seek to amend adversely or discontinue the Policy or allow the Policy to lapse (without entering into a renewal or replacement thereof on similar terms) without the Indemnified Party&#8217;s prior written consent, acting reasonably. Should the Indemnified Party cease to be a director and/or officer of the Corporation, for any reason whatsoever, the Corporation shall continue to purchase and maintain directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance for the benefit of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party&#8217;s heirs and legal representatives, such that the Indemnified Party&#8217;s insurance coverage is, at all times up to and including the Termination Date, the same as any insurance coverage the Corporation purchases and maintains for the benefit of its then current directors and/or officers from time to time.(c)Run-Off Coverage - In the event the Policy is discontinued for any reason, or in the event of a consummation of a Control Transaction, the Corporation shall purchase, maintain and administer, or cause to be purchased, maintained and administered for a period of six years after such discontinuance or the effective time of the Control Transaction, insurance for the benefit of the Indemnified Party (the &#8220;Run-Off Coverage&#8221;), on similar terms to the extent permitted by law and provided such Run-Off Coverage is available on commercially acceptable terms and premiums (as determined by the board of directors in its reasonable and good faith opinion), provided that the premiums for the Run-Off Coverage will be deemed to be commercially acceptable if the total premiums for such Run-Off Coverage do not exceed 300% of annual premiums under the Policy at the time they are discontinued). The Run-Off Coverage shall provide coverage only in respect of events occurring prior to the discontinuance of the Policy or the effective time of the Control Transaction. The Corporation will provide to the Indemnified Party a copy of each policy of insurance providing the coverages contemplated by this subsection 3.1(c) promptly after coverage is obtained and evidence of each annual renewal thereof and will promptly notify the Indemnified Party if the insurer cancels, makes material changes to coverage, or refuses to renew coverage (or any part of the coverage).(d)Exclusion of Indemnity - Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity to pursuant any valid and collectible policy of insurance obtained and maintained by the Corporation, to the extent of the amounts actually collected by the Indemnified Party under such insurance policy. Where partial indemnity is provided by such insurance policy, the obligation of the Corporation under Section 2.1 shall continue in effect but be limited to that portion of the Losses for which indemnity is not provided by such insurance policy.&#8203;-8-&#8203;ARTICLE&#160;4MISCELLANEOUS4.1Corporation and Indemnified Party to CooperateThe Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall, from time to time, provide such information and cooperate with the other, as the other may reasonably request, in respect of all matters under this Agreement.4.2Effective TimeThis Agreement shall be deemed to have effect as and from the first date that the Indemnified Party became a director or officer, or held a position equivalent to that of a director or officer, of the Corporation or Other Entity and shall apply to all actions and proceedings, whether such action or proceeding is in respect of facts arising before or subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement.4.3InsolvencyThe liability of the Corporation under this Agreement shall not be affected, discharged, impaired, mitigated or released by reason of the discharge or release of the Indemnified Party in any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding of creditors to the extent permitted by applicable laws.4.4Multiple ProceedingsNo action or proceeding brought or instituted under this Agreement and no recovery pursuant thereto shall be a bar or defence to any further action or proceeding which may be brought under this Agreement.4.5Non-Exclusive IndemnificationThe Corporation shall provide the Indemnified Party with all of the indemnifications, protections and benefits it may provide pursuant to the Act.
