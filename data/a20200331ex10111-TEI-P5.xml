I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Lenders and the Agent.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the State of Michigan and the federal law of the United States.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">1.    The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">2.    The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower’s corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower, or (iii) any contractual restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">3.    No consent, authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery, recordation, filing or performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">4.    The Credit Agreement has been, and each of the Notes when delivered will have been, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">5.    Except as may have been disclosed to you in the SEC Reports, to the best of my knowledge (after due inquiry) there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings affecting the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that (i) could be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) purport to affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of any Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">6.    In a properly presented case, a Michigan court or a federal court sitting in the State of Michigan applying Michigan choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents and should hold that the Loan Documents are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Michigan. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by their terms the Loan Documents expressly select New York law as the laws governing their interpretation and that the Loan Documents governed by New York law were delivered by the parties thereto to the Agent in New York. The choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents are not voidable under the laws of the State of Michigan.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">7.    If, despite the provisions of Section 8.09 of the Credit Agreement, wherein the parties thereto agree that the Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, a court of the State of Michigan or a federal court sitting in the State of Michigan were to hold that the Loan Documents are governed by, and to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, the Loan Documents would be, under the laws of the State of Michigan, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">8.    Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an “investment company,” or an “affiliated person” of, or “promoter” or “principal underwriter” for, an “investment company,” as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">(a)    My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">(b)    My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">(c)    I express no opinion as to participation and the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Michigan wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Loan Documents may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">I am a member of the Bar of the State of Michigan, and do not express any opinion concerning any law other than the law of the State of Michigan and the federal laws of the United States of America.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="font-family:inherit">This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction.
