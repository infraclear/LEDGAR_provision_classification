The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to make the Terms Loans, change the Interest Period, and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Change Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation (signed by an authorized representative of the Borrower) of each telephonic notice, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.</p><p>2.9.    Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.

If any payment of principal of or interest on a Term Loan shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.</p><p>2.10.    Notification of Loans, Interest Rates and Prepayments. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Borrowing Notice, Change Notice and repayment notice received by it hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of the Agent to provide such notice to the Lenders shall not affect the validity or binding nature of such notice delivered to the Agent by the Borrower. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Term Loan promptly upon determination of such interest rate.</p><p>2.11.    Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any U.S. Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time.

If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three (3) days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.</p><p>2.13.    Replacement of Lender. If (a) the Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender’s obligation to make Term Loans is suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or (b) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected as described in subclauses (a) or (b) an “Affected Lender”), the Borrower may (but only, in the case of clause (a), if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective) elect to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including, without limitation, any payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.</p><p>2.14.    Defaulting Lenders.</p><p>(a)    Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:</p><p>(i)    Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 8.2.</p><p>(ii)    Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8.1 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.1), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Unmatured Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; third, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Unmatured Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.</p><p>(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.</p><p>ARTICLE III    <lb/><lb/>YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES</p><p>3.1.    Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, any Change in Law:</p><p>(i)    subjects the Agent, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than in each case with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Loans or</p><p>(ii)    imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Term Loans), or</p><p>(iii)    imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or maintaining its Term Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its Term Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Term Loans or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,</p><p>and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Agent, such Lender or applicable Lending Installation, as the case may be, of continuing the Interest Period then applicable to its Loans through the end of such period or making or maintaining its Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Loans or Commitment, then, within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.</p><p>3.2.    Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines that the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change in Law, then, within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital or liquidity which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make Loans (after taking into account such Lender’s policies as to capital adequacy).</p><p>3.3.    Availability of Loans.</p><p>(a)    If (x) any Lender determines that maintenance of its Term Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or if (y) the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Term Loans are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Term Loans does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Term Loans, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of Term Loans and require any affected Term Loans to be repaid, subject to Section 3.3(b) and the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.</p><p>(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the determination described in Section 3.3(a)(y) (the “Unavailability Determination”) has been made, the Agent and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to determine an alternative interest rate for the Term Loans; provided, that (i) until such agreement is reached, the availability of Term Loans shall be suspended as provided in Section 3.3(a) and (ii) if the Agent and the Borrower have not agreed to an alternative interest rate within three Business Days, the Borrower shall be required to repay the affected Term Loans as set forth in Section 3.3(a). The alternative interest rate agreed to pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall apply retroactively to the affected Term Loans commencing on the day on which the Unavailability Determination was made. In the event an interest payment is required pursuant to Section 2.9 after the Unavailability Determination has been made but prior to an alternative interest rate being established, such interest payment shall be deferred until the earlier of (i) the date on which an alternative interest rate is established for the Term Loans and (ii) the date on which the Borrower is required to repay the affected Term Loans.</p><p>3.4.    Funding Indemnification. If:</p><p>(i)    any payment of a Term Loan occurs on a date that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise;</p><p>(ii)    a Term Loan is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders;</p><p>(iii)    a Term Loan is converted other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto;</p><p>(iv)    the Borrower fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay a Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto; or</p><p>(v)    a Term Loan is assigned other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13,</p><p>the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for such Lender’s costs, expenses and Interest Differential (as determined by such Lender) incurred as a result of such prepayment. The term “Interest Differential” means the greater of zero and the financial loss incurred by the Lender resulting from prepayment, calculated as the difference between the amount of interest such Lender would have earned (from like investments as of the first day of the Interest Period) had prepayment not occurred and the interest such Lender will actually earn (from like investments as of the date of prepayment) as a result of the redeployment of funds from the prepayment. Because of the short-term duration of any Interest Period, the Borrower agrees that the Interest Differential shall not be discounted to its present value.</p><p>The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the Borrower shall be required to pay Interest Differential with respect to any portion of the principal balance accelerated or paid before the end of the Interest Period for such Term Loan, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or otherwise, including without limitation any principal payment required upon maturity when the Borrower has elected an Interest Period that extends beyond the scheduled maturity date of such Term Loan and any principal payment required following default, demand for payment, acceleration, collection proceedings, foreclosure, sale or other disposition of collateral, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, eminent domain, condemnation, application of insurance proceeds, or otherwise. Such Interest Differential shall at all times be an Obligation as well as an undertaking by the Borrower to the Lenders whether arising out of a voluntary or mandatory prepayment.</p><p>3.5.    Taxes.</p><p>(i)    All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes, except to the extent such Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement but fails to properly and timely complete and execute documentation as provided in Section 3.5(iv) or Section 3.5(vi), as the case may be. Subject to each Lender’s and the Agent’s compliance with Section 3.5(iv) and Section 3.5(vi), if the Borrower or the Agent shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower or the Agent, as applicable, shall make such deductions, (c) the Borrower or the Agent, as applicable, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within thirty (30) days after such payment is made.</p><p>(ii)    In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise (but excluding Excluded Taxes) or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement (“Other Taxes”).</p><p>(iii)    Except as otherwise provided herein, the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify the Agent or any Lender for interest, penalties or associated expenses described in the foregoing if such liability is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date the Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.</p><p>(iv)    Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a “Non-U.S. Lender”) agrees that it will, not less than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, ten (10) Business Days after such Lender shall become a Lender pursuant to Section 12.3), deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY and related documentation, certifying in either case that such Lender (or beneficial owners, as applicable) is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.</p><p>(v)    For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv), above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv), above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.</p><p>(vi)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax, including backup withholding, with respect to payments under this Agreement pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In the event such Lender has failed timely to provide the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) with such properly completed and executed documentation, such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes withheld to the extent such Taxes would have been reduced or exempt from withholding had such properly completed and executed documentation been timely provided to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent).</p><p>(vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent); provided that no Lender shall be required to indemnify the Agent for any of the foregoing to the extent the failure of the Agent to withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. In addition, each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent for any taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.2(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.</p><p>(viii)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (viii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.</p><p>3.6.    Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Term Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Term Loans under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall notify the Borrower of any amounts due under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5 as soon as reasonably practicable and, thereafter, deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under such Section(s). Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Term Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Term Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Term Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.</p><p>ARTICLE IV    <lb/><lb/>CONDITIONS PRECEDENT</p><p>4.1.    Effectiveness.

No part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder will be unlawfully used directly or indirectly to fund any operations in, finance any investments or activities in or make any payments to, a Sanctioned Person or a Sanctioned Country, or in any other manner that will result in any violation by any Person (including any Lender, any Arranger or the Agent) of any Anti-Terrorism Laws.</p><p>ARTICLE VI    <lb/><lb/>COVENANTS</p><p>So long as any Lender has any Commitment hereunder or any Obligations are outstanding, the Borrower shall, unless the Required Lenders otherwise consent in writing:</p><p>6.1.    Preservation of Existence and Business.

The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Agent is authorized to act as such).

The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.</p><p>9.7.    Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.</p><p>9.8.    Accounting.

Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.9, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by bankruptcy or other similar debtor relief laws, as determined in good faith by the Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.</p><p>9.10.    Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders, the Arrangers, the Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. None of the Agent, any Arranger or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower.

Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities (“Participants”) participating interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.</p><p>(b)    Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal or interest or reduces the interest rate payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, extends the Scheduled Termination Date, postpones any date fixed for any regularly scheduled payment of principal of, or interest on, any such Loan or Commitment.</p><p>(c)    Participant Register. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s Loans and Commitments, and rights and obligations with respect thereto, assigned.</p><p>(iii)    Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (a)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:</p><p>(A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) a Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and</p><p>(B)    the consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Loan, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender.</p><p>(iv)    Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Agent an administrative questionnaire in a form acceptable to the Agent.</p><p>(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) a natural person.</p><p>(vi)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.</p><p>Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment Agreement, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Article III and Section 9.6 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2 (other than a purported assignment to a natural Person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates, which shall be null and void).</p><p>(b)    Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Agent’s office a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.</p><p>12.4.    Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a “Transferee”) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any information contained in any Annual Report on Form 10-K or any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.</p><p>12.5.    Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv) and Section 3.5(vi), as applicable.</p><p>12.6.    Designation of SPVs.</p><p>(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPV”, identified as such in writing from time to time by such Granting Lender to the Agent and the Borrower) the option to fund all or any part of any Term Loan or fee or expense reimbursement or other obligation (each, a “Lender Funding Obligation”) that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to fund any Lender Funding Obligation, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of any such Lender Funding Obligation, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Lender Funding Obligation pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) no SPV shall exercise any voting rights pursuant to Section 8.2 (such voting rights to be exercised instead by such Granting Lender) and (iv) with respect to notices, payments and other matters hereunder, the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated to deal with an SPV, but may limit their communications and other dealings relevant to such SPV to the applicable Granting Lender. The funding of any Lender Funding Obligation by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent that, and as if, such Lender Funding Obligation were funded by such Granting Lender.</p><p>(b)    As to any Lender Funding Obligations or portion thereof made by it, each SPV shall have all the rights that its applicable Granting Lender making such Lender Funding Obligations or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement; provided that each SPV shall have granted to its Granting Lender an irrevocable power of attorney to deliver and receive all communications and notices under this Agreement (and any related documents) and to exercise on such SPV’s behalf, all of such SPV’s voting rights under this Agreement. No additional Note shall be required to evidence the Lender Funding Obligations or portion thereof made by an SPV; and the related Granting Lender shall be deemed to hold its Note as agent for such SPV to the extent of the Lender Funding Obligations or portion thereof funded by such SPV. In addition, any payments for the account of any SPV shall be paid to its Granting Lender as agent for such SPV.</p><p>(c)    Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreements shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.</p><p>(d)    In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any SPV may (i) at any time and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign or participate all or a portion of its interest in any Lender Funding Obligations to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Lender Funding Obligations and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Lender Funding Obligations to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPV. This Section 12.6 may not be amended without the written consent of any Granting Lender affected thereby.</p><p>ARTICLE XIII    <lb/><lb/>NOTICES</p><p>13.1.    Notices.</p><p>(a)    Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.8 with respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including electronic transmission, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address or facsimile number set forth on Schedule 13.1 or at such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section or (iv) if given by electronic transmission, as provided in Section 13.1(b); provided that notices to the Agent under Article II shall not be effective until received.</p><p>(b)    Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Agent or as otherwise determined by the Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender has notified the Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Agent or the Borrower may, in its respective discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise determines, provided that such determination or approval may be limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not given during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.</p><p>13.2.    Change of Address. The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto.</p><p>ARTICLE XIV    <lb/><lb/>COUNTERPARTS</p><p>This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement and any other Loan Document or Assignment Agreement by facsimile or electronic (i.e., “pdf” or “tif”) format shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such Loan Document or Assignment Agreement.</p><p>ARTICLE XV    <lb/><lb/>CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION</p><p>15.1.    CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.</p><p>15.2.    CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.</p><p>[REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]</p><p>14</p><p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.</p><p>PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY</p><p>By:</p><p>/s/ James F.
