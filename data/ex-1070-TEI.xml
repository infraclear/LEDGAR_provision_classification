Promptly following its receipt of any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will pay to each Lender that has acquired a participation therein such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such payment in accordance with Section 2.11.</p><p>(f)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the obligation of each Lender (other than the Swingline Lender) to make Revolving Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(c) and each such Lender’s obligation to purchase a participation in any unpaid Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.7(d) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance or event whatsoever, including, without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of any Unmatured Default or Default, or (iii) the failure of the amount of such Advance of Revolving Loans to meet the minimum borrowing amount specified in Section 2.3.</p><p>2.8    Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section 2.8 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.6. Each Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.6 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance continue as a Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period. Subject to Section 2.3, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a “Conversion/Continuation Notice”) of each conversion of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:</p><p>(i)    the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such conversion or continuation,</p><p>(ii)    the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be converted or continued, and</p><p>(iii)    the amount of such Advance, which is to be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto.</p><p>25</p><p rend="First Paragraph">2.9    Changes in Interest Rate, etc.</p><p>(a)    Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Floating Rate Advance is made or is automatically converted from a Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.8, to the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.8, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Revolving Loan maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.</p><p>(b)    Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower’s selections under Sections 2.7 and 2.8 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date.</p><p>(c)    Each LIBOR Market Index Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such LIBOR Market Index Rate Advance is made to the date it is paid at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Market Index Rate for such day.</p><p>2.10    Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.7, 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower, declare that no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance. During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower, declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum, (ii) each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum (iii) each LIBOR Market Index Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Market Index Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum, and (iv) the LC Fee shall be increased by 2% per annum, provided that during the continuance of a Default under Sections 7(g) or 7(h), the interest rates set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and the increase in the LC Fee set forth in clause (iv) above shall be applicable to all Credit Extensions without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.</p><p>2.11    Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s address specified pursuant to Article 13, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by 12:00 noon on the date when due and shall (except for payments of Reimbursement Obligations for which the applicable LC Issuer has not received payments from the Lenders or as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified</p><p>26</p><p rend="First Paragraph">pursuant to Article 13 or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge any account of the Borrower maintained with Wells Fargo for each payment of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and fees as it becomes due hereunder. Each reference to the Administrative Agent in this Section 2.11 shall also be deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, (i) to the Swingline Lender, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower to the Swingline Lender and (ii) to the applicable LC Issuer, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower to such LC Issuer.</p><p>2.12    Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.</p><p>(a)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.</p><p>(b)    The Administrative Agent shall also maintain the Register pursuant to Section 12.3(d) and subaccounts for each Lender in which (taken together) it will record (a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period (if any) with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (c) the original stated amount of each Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, and (d) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof.</p><p>(c)    The entries maintained in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to Sections 2.12(a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.</p><p>(d)    The Loans made by each Lender shall, if requested by the applicable Lender (which request shall be made to the Administrative Agent), be evidenced (i) in the case of Revolving Loans, by a Revolving Note, and (ii) in the case of the Swingline Loans, by a Swingline Note, in each case appropriately completed and executed by the Borrower and payable to the order of such Lender. Each Note shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall be subject to the provisions hereof and thereof.</p><p>2.13    Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices, Swingline Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any</p><p>27</p><p rend="First Paragraph">Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.</p><p>2.14    Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis; Maximum Rate.</p><p>(a)    Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which such Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at the Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion.</p><p>(b)    Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at the Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period.</p><p>(c)    Interest accrued on each LIBOR Market Rate Advance shall be payable on any date on which such LIBOR Market Rate Advance is paid in full, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and on the date such LIBOR Market Index Rate Advance shall become due and payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b).</p><p>(d)    Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.</p><p>(e)    Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.</p><p>(f)    Interest on Floating Rate Advances bearing interest at the Prime Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365, or when appropriate, 366 day year. All other interest and all fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 12:00 noon at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day (except for interest payments in respect of Eurodollar Advances whose Interest Period ends on a day which is not a Business Day, and the next succeeding Business Day falls in a new calendar month, in which case interest accrued on such Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the immediately preceding Business Day) and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.</p><p>(g)    In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts deemed interest under this Agreement charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any applicable law which a court of competent</p><p>28</p><p rend="First Paragraph">jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by applicable law and the Lenders shall at the Administrative Agent’s option (i) promptly refund to the Borrower any interest received by the Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate or (ii) apply such excess to the principal balance of the Obligations on a pro rata basis. It is the intent hereof that the Borrower not pay or contract to pay, and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be paid by the Borrower under applicable law.</p><p>2.15    Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice (including Borrowing Notices received from the Swingline Lender in accordance with Section 2.7(c)), Swingline Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. Promptly after notice from any LC Issuer, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance and each LIBOR Market Index Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.</p><p>2.16    Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans, its participations in any outstanding Swingline Loans, and its participation in any LC Obligations and any LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender or such LC Issuer, as the case may be, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans, Facility LCs, participations in outstanding Swingline Loans, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender or each LC Issuer, as the case may be, for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender and each LC Issuer may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article 13, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and for whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to be made.</p><p>2.17    Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the</p><p>29</p><p rend="First Paragraph">Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three (3) days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.</p><p>2.18    Facility LCs.</p><p>(a)    Each LC Issuer hereby agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Section 2.18, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue letters of credit (each, a “Facility LC”) and to renew, extend, increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC (“Modify,” and each such action a “Modification”), from time to time from the Closing Date and prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date upon the request of the Borrower; provided that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified, (i) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment, (ii) the sum of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all Facility LCs outstanding at such time issued by the LC Issuers and the Reimbursement Obligations shall not exceed the LC Subcommitment, (iii) the sum of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all Facility LCs issued by any LC Issuer and the Reimbursement Obligations owed to such LC Issuer shall not exceed such LC Issuer’s LC Commitment, and (iv) no Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, unless the LC Issuer has entered into an arrangement, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such LC Issuer (in its sole discretion), with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the LC Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Facility LC then proposed to be issued or that Facility LC and the Outstanding Credit Exposure as to which such LC Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion. No Facility LC shall have an expiry date later than the earlier of (A) the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date and (B) one year after its issuance (the “Facility LC Maturity Date”), provided that any Facility LC with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (but in no event beyond the date referred to in clause (A) above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no LC Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Facility LC if (x) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the LC Issuer from issuing such Facility LC, or any law applicable to such LC Issuer or (y) any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the LC Issuer shall (1) prohibit, or request that the LC Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Facility LC in particular or (2) impose upon the LC Issuer with respect to such Facility LC any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the LC Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date or shall impose upon the LC Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date, in each case under this clause (y)(2) which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it, unless the Borrower agrees in writing to indemnify the LC Issuer for any such costs.</p><p>(b)    Upon the issuance or Modification by any LC Issuer of a Facility LC in accordance with this Section 2.18, such LC Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably</p><p>30</p><p rend="First Paragraph">purchased from such LC Issuer without recourse or warranty, a participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) and the related LC Obligations in proportion to its Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, effective upon any increase or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to the terms hereunder, each Lender’s participation in any Facility LC outstanding on such date shall be adjusted to reflect its Pro Rata Share after giving effect to such increase or reduction, as the case may be.</p><p>(c)    Subject to Section 2.18(a), the Borrower shall give the applicable LC Issuer notice prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the LC Issuer in any given case) prior to the proposed date of issuance or Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date of such Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable LC Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender, of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s participation in such proposed Facility LC. The issuance or Modification by any LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article 4 (the satisfaction of which the LC Issuer shall have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to such LC Issuer, acting reasonably, and that the Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as such LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a “Facility LC Application”). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.</p><p>(d)    The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, with respect to each Facility LC issued hereunder, a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Advances in effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such standby Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, on the Facility LC Maturity Date and thereafter on demand (each such fee described in this sentence an “LC Fee”), provided, however, that any LC Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Facility LC as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.22(c) shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Pro Rata Shares allocable to such Facility LC, with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the LC Issuer for its own account; provided further, that so long as no Unmatured Default or Default exists, notwithstanding the Pricing Level otherwise applicable to the Advances, Facility LCs and Facility Fee, the Borrower shall be required to pay an LC Fee on any portion of any Facility LC that the Borrower has Cash Collateralized at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans corresponding to Pricing Level I. The Borrower shall also pay to the applicable LC Issuer for its own account (x) a fronting fee at the per annum rate set forth in the Senior Lead Arrangers Fee Letter or as separately agreed with such LC Issuer on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each Facility LC issued hereunder, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, and (y) documentary and processing charges in connection with the issuance or Modification of and</p><p>31</p><p rend="First Paragraph">draws under Facility LCs in accordance with the applicable LC Issuer’s standard schedule for such charges as in effect from time to time.</p><p>(e)    Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Facility LC of any demand for payment under such Facility LC, the applicable LC Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid by such LC Issuer as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the “LC Payment Date”). The responsibility of such LC Issuer to the Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC. Each LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are granted. Each Lender’s obligation to reimburse each LC Issuer for its Pro Rata Share of the amount drawn under each Facility LCs to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(f) below shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the LC Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable LC Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to this foregoing provisions of this Section 2.18(e), such LC Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the LC Payment Date to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the LC Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first three (3) days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances.</p><p>(f)    The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse any LC Issuer on the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by such LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided that, subject to Section 2.18(h), the Borrower shall not be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) such LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. All such amounts paid by such LC Issuer and remaining unpaid by the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls on or before the applicable LC Payment Date and (y) the sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls after such LC Payment Date. The applicable LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share all amounts received by it from the Borrower for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC issued by such LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to such LC Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant to Section 2.18(e). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement</p><p>32</p><p rend="First Paragraph">(including the submission of a Borrowing Notice in compliance with Section 2.7 and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 4), the Borrower may request an Advance hereunder for the purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.</p><p>(g)    The Borrower’s obligations to reimburse each LC Issuer for each drawing under each Facility LC shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Facility LC, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Facility LC (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the LC Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Facility LC or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Facility LC proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (iv) any payment by the applicable LC Issuer under such Facility LC against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Facility LC; or any payment made by the LC Issuer under such Facility LC to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; (v) any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred; (vi) any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee; or (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower. No LC Issuer shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any LC Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not put any LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to the Borrower. Nothing in this Section 2.18(g) is intended to limit the right of the Borrower to make a claim against any LC Issuer for damages as contemplated by Section 2.18(h).</p><p>(h)    Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable LC Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the applicable Facility LC) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document, provided that at all times the LC Issuer shall be acting in good faith. None of the LC Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any LC Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,</p><p>33</p><p rend="First Paragraph">effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Facility LC. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.18, each LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Facility LC. None of the LC Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any LC Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of Section 2.18(g); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against any LC Issuer, and such LC Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final nonappealable judgment to have resulted from such LC Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.</p><p>(i)    The Borrower agrees that it will, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (i) when a Default exists and until the final expiration date of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to any LC Issuer or the Lenders in respect of any Facility LC or (ii) if, as of the Facility Termination Date, any LC Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, maintain a special collateral account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (the “Facility LC Collateral Account”) at the Administrative Agent’s office at the address specified pursuant to Article 13, in the name of such Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and in which such Borrower shall have no interest other than as set forth in Section 8.1. The Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the LC Issuers, a security interest in all of the Borrower’s right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the LC Obligations.

If any Lender requests compensation under Sections 3.1 or 3.2, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.5 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Installation in accordance with Section 3.6, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof as contemplated by Section 8.2(i) or (ii), the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required shall not have been obtained, in each case, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 12.3), all of its</p><p>34</p><p rend="First Paragraph">interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.1 or 3.2 or Section 3.5) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);

provided that no Lender shall have any obligation hereunder to become an Increasing Lender and any election to do so shall be in the sole discretion of each Lender; provided further that: (i) any such request for a Commitment Increase shall be in a</p><p>35</p><p rend="First Paragraph">minimum amount of $10,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000; (ii) immediately after giving effect to any Commitment Increase, the Aggregate Commitment shall not exceed $150,000,000 and the aggregate amount of all Commitment Increases shall not exceed $25,000,000; (iii) the sum of the increases in Commitments of the Increasing Lenders and the new Commitments of the Assuming Lenders shall not exceed the requested Commitment Increase; (iv) no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the applicable Commitment Increase Date or shall result from any Commitment Increase; and (v) the representations and warranties contained in Article 5 (other than in Section 5.5) shall be true on and as of the Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation and warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specified date, as of such specific date).</p><p>(b)    Each Commitment Increase (and the increase of the Commitment of each Increasing Lender and/or the new Commitment of each Assuming Lender, as applicable, resulting therefrom) shall become effective as of the Commitment Increase Date; provided that: (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 10:00 a.m. on such Commitment Increase Date a certificate of an Authorized Officer stating that each of the applicable conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in Section 2.20(a) has been satisfied and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such Commitment Increase; (ii) with respect to each Assuming Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have received, on or prior to 10:00 a.m. on such Commitment Increase Date, a Joinder Agreement among the Assuming Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent; and (iii) each Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 10:00 a.m. on such Commitment Increase Date, confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to its increased Commitment, with a copy of such confirmation to the Borrower.</p><p>(c)    On each Commitment Increase Date upon such time as the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 2.20(a) and 2.20(b) have been satisfied, the Borrower shall (i) prepay the then outstanding Advances (if any) in full prior to giving effect to such Commitment Increase, (ii) if the Borrower shall so request, request new Advances from the Lenders (including any Assuming Lender) in an aggregate amount at least equal to such prepayment, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Advances are held ratably by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) and (iii) pay to the Lenders any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.3.</p><p>2.21    Extension of Facility Termination Date.</p><p>(a)    So long as no Unmatured Default or Default has occurred and is continuing and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.21(c), the Borrower may, not more than two (2) times during the term of this Agreement, no earlier than sixty (60) days and no later than thirty (30) days prior to each anniversary of the Closing Date (such anniversary, an “Extension Date”) request through written notice to the Administrative Agent (the “Extension Notice”), that the Lenders extend the then existing Facility Termination Date for an additional one-year period. Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent no later than the applicable Extension Date (except in the year in which the then existing Facility Termination Date shall occur, in which case such written notice shall be delivered by the Lenders no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the then existing Facility Termination Date) (such date,</p><p>36</p><p rend="First Paragraph">the “Consent Date”), advise the Administrative Agent in writing of its desire to extend (any such Lender, a “Consenting Lender”) or not to so extend (any such Lender, a “Non-Consenting Lender”) such date. Any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent by the Consent Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender. No Lender shall be under any obligation or commitment to extend the then existing Facility Termination Date. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to agree to such extension.</p><p>(b)    On the Consent Date, if Lenders holding Commitments that aggregate more than 50% of the Aggregate Commitments shall have agreed to such extension, then the then existing Facility Termination Date applicable to the Consenting Lenders shall be extended to the date that is one (1) year after the then existing Facility Termination Date. All Advances of each Non-Consenting Lender shall be subject to the then existing Facility Termination Date, without giving effect to such extension (such date, the “Prior Termination Date”). In the event of an extension of the then existing Facility Termination Date pursuant to this Section 2.21, the Borrower shall have the right, at its own expense, to solicit commitments from existing Lenders and/or other banks or financial institutions reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer (each, an “Eligible Replacement Lender”) to replace the Commitment of any Non-Consenting Lenders for the remaining duration of this Agreement. Any Eligible Replacement Lender (if not already a Lender hereunder) shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by delivering an executed Joinder Agreement to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. The Commitment of each Non-Consenting Lender shall terminate on the Prior Termination Date, all Advances and other amounts payable hereunder to such Non-Consenting Lenders shall be subject to the Prior Termination Date and, to the extent such Non-Consenting Lender’s Commitment is not replaced as provided above, the Commitments hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of the Commitment of each such Non-Consenting Lender so terminated on the Prior Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.21, the Facility Termination Date shall not be extended unless the aggregate Commitments of the Consenting Lenders and any Eligible Replacement Lenders joining this Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.21(b) are greater than or equal to the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure as of each Prior Termination Date.</p><p>(c)    An extension of the Facility Termination Date pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall only become effective upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a certificate (the statements contained in which shall be true) of a duly authorized officer of the Borrower stating that both before and after giving effect to such extension of the Facility Termination Date (i) no Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) all representations and warranties contained in Article 5 are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date such extension is made, except for such representations or warranties which by their terms are made as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct as of such specified date.</p><p>(d)    Effective on and after the Prior Termination Date, (i) each of the Non-Consenting Lenders shall be automatically released from their respective LC Obligations and (ii) the LC Obligations of each Lender (other than the Non-Consenting Lenders) shall be automatically adjusted to equal such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such LC Obligations.</p><p>37</p><p rend="First Paragraph">2.22    Defaulting Lenders.</p><p>(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:</p><p>(i)    Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.</p><p>(ii)    Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 7 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.1 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any LC Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.22(c); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Facility LCs issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.22(c); sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the LC Issuers or Swingline Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the LC Issuers or Swingline Lenders against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Facility LCs were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Obligations and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Facility without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Unmatured Default or Default exists, notwithstanding the Pricing Level otherwise applicable to the Advances, Facility LCs and Facility Fee, the Borrower shall be required to pay an LC Fee on any portion of any Facility LC that the Borrower has Cash Collateralized at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans corresponding to Pricing Level I.</p><p>(iv)    All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Obligations and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.</p><p>(v)    If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy</p><p>39</p><p rend="First Paragraph">available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders’ Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.22(c).</p><p>(vi)    If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and each LC Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause each Lender to hold its Pro Rata Share of the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Facility LCs and Swingline Loans (without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.</p><p>(b)    So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is reasonably satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no LC Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Facility LC unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.</p><p>(c)    At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within two (2) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any LC Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.</p><p>(i)    The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuers, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders’ obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuers as herein provided (other than liens permitted pursuant to Section 6.11), or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).</p><p>40</p><p rend="First Paragraph">(ii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.22 in respect of Facility LCs shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.</p><p>(iii)    Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to this Section 2.22 the Person providing Cash Collateral and each LC Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.</p><p>2.23    Changed Circumstances.</p><p>(a)    In connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Advance (or a Floating Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate) or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Advance, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the Eurodollar Base Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Advance (or a Floating Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate) or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Eurodollar Base Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Advances during such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower.

Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver to the Borrower after receiving notice thereof from such affected Lender), (i) the obligations of such Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances (or Floating Rate Advances as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate), and the right of the Borrower to convert any Advance to a Eurodollar Rate Advance or continue any Advance as an Eurodollar Rate Advance with respect to such Lenders (or a Floating Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate) shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may, with respect to such Lenders, select only Floating Rate Advances (as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate, (ii) all Floating Rate Advances made by such Lenders shall cease to be determined by reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a Eurodollar Rate Advances to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Floating Rate Advance (as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Base Rate) for the remainder of such Interest Period.</p><p>ARTICLE 3</p><p>YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES</p><p>3.1    Increased Costs.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 3.5(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.5(h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.5(h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional</p><p>47</p><p rend="First Paragraph">amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.

The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article 10. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term “Administrative Agent,” it is expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.</p><p>10.2    Powers. The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Administrative Agent.</p><p>69</p><p rend="First Paragraph">10.3    General Immunity. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.</p><p>10.4    No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 4, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of the Borrower or any guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower’s or any such guarantor’s respective Subsidiaries. Except as set forth herein and in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.</p><p>10.5    Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.</p><p>10.6    Employment of Administrative Agents, Counsel, Accountants, and Other Experts. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders (except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents) for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Facility LC, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the LC Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the LC Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the LC Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Facility LC.</p><p>10.8    Administrative Agent’s Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (x) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent and (y) any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(e) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof.

The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default”. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.</p><p>10.10    Rights as a Lender. In the event the Administrative Agent is a Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan</p><p>71</p><p rend="First Paragraph">Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, at any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary without any duty to account therefore to the Lenders.

The provisions of this Article 10 (other than Section 10.10) shall apply to each LC Issuer and the Swingline Lender mutatis mutandis to the same extent as such provisions apply to the Administrative Agent.</p><p>ARTICLE 11</p><p>SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS</p><p>11.1    Setoff. If a Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each LC Issuer, and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender, such LC Issuer or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such LC Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether</p><p>73</p><p rend="First Paragraph">or not such Lender, LC Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or such LC Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers, and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, each LC Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such LC Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and LC Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.</p><p>11.2    Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other than payments received pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Share of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to Indebtedness of the Borrower to a Lender other than Indebtedness comprised of the Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness comprised of such Outstanding Credit Exposure.</p><p>ARTICLE 12</p><p>BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS</p><p>12.1    Successors and Assigns.

The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights</p><p>74</p><p rend="First Paragraph">under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; provided that no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3; provided that the Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.</p><p>12.2    Participations.</p><p>(a)    Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities (“Participants”) participating interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.</p><p>(b)    Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Credit Extension or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, extends the Facility Termination Date (except as otherwise permitted in accordance with Section 2.21), postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan or Commitment, or postpones the expiry date of any Facility LC beyond the Facility Termination Date, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases all or substantially all of the collateral, if any, securing any such Loan.</p><p>(c)    The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by</p><p>75</p><p rend="First Paragraph">exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.</p><p>(d)    Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person other than the Borrower except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.</p><p>(e)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.</p><p>12.3    Assignments.</p><p>(a)    Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or more Purchasers all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof; provided that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall (unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents) be in an amount not less than the lesser of (i) $10,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment) or Outstanding Credit Exposure (if the applicable Commitment has been terminated).</p><p>(b)    Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by Section 12.3(a), and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee by the assigning Lender to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by the</p><p>76</p><p rend="First Paragraph">Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes “plan assets” as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be “plan assets” under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3(a), the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.</p><p>(c)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable Pro Rata Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Pro Rata Share of all Loans and participations in Facility LCs and Swingline Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.</p><p>(d)    The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at its office referred to in Schedule 13.1 a copy of each assignment agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and Outstanding Credit Exposure owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any LC Issuer, any</p><p>77</p><p rend="First Paragraph">Lender and the Swingline Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.</p><p>12.4    Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a “Transferee”) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including any information contained in any Reports; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.10 of this Agreement.</p><p>12.5    Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee, which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(g)(ii)(B) and such Transferee shall not be entitled to any additional payments under Section 3.5, (i) unless, and only to the extent, that the transferor Lender was entitled to amounts under Section 3.5, or (ii) in the event that payments to the Transferee were not subject to any withholding at the time of transfer and became subject to withholding as a result of a Change In Law.</p><p>ARTICLE 13</p><p>NOTICES</p><p>13.1    Notices.</p><p>(a)    Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.13 with respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including electronic transmission, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x) in the case of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on Schedule 13.1, (y) in the case of any Lender, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article 2 shall not be effective until received. Notices delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such subsection (b).</p><p>(b)    Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article 2 if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of</p><p>78</p><p rend="First Paragraph">receiving notices under such Section by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its respective discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise determines, provided that such determination or approval may be limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is not given during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications posted to an internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor.</p><p>13.2    Change of Address. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto.</p><p>ARTICLE 14</p><p>CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</p><p>14.1    CHOICE OF LAW.
