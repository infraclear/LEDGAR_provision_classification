There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments.

Any such appointment and the terms thereof shall be evidenced in a separate written agreement executed by the Borrower and the relevant LC Issuing Bank, a copy of which agreement shall be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice of any such appointment to the other Lenders. Upon such appointment, if and for so long as such Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder or any Letter of Credit issued by such Lender shall remain outstanding, such Lender shall be deemed to be, and shall have all the rights and obligations of, an “LC Issuing Bank” under this Agreement. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c)No Letter of Credit shall be requested, issued or modified hereunder if, after the issuance or modification thereof, (i) the Outstanding Credits would exceed the Commitments then scheduled to be in effect until the latest Termination Date, (ii) that portion of the LC Outstandings arising from Letters of Credit issued by an LC Issuing Bank would exceed the amount of such LC Issuing Bank’s Fronting Commitment or (iii) the LC Outstandings would exceed the LC Commitment Amount. No LC Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such LC Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such LC Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such LC Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the LC Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the LC Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the LC Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated or required to be compensated hereunder), which restriction, reserve or capital requirement was not in effect on the date hereof, or shall impose upon the LC Issuing Bank any loss, cost or expense (not reimbursed or required to be reimbursed) that was not applicable on the date hereof and that the LC Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it.</p><p style="text-align: right;">39</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d)The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each LC Issuing Bank and each Lender that has funded its participation in the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower pursuant to subsection (e) below, on demand made by such LC Issuing Bank to the Borrower, on and after each date on which such LC Issuing Bank shall pay any amount under any Letter of Credit issued by such LC Issuing Bank, a sum equal to the amount so paid (the “<hi rend="italic bold">Reimbursement Amount</hi>”). Any Reimbursement Amount shall bear interest, payable on demand, from the date so paid by such LC Issuing Bank until repayment to such LC Issuing Bank in full at a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans plus, if any amount paid by such LC Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit is not reimbursed by the Borrower within three Business Days, 2%. The Borrower may satisfy its obligation hereunder to repay the Reimbursement Amount by requesting a Borrowing under Section 2.02 (and which Borrowing shall be subject to the conditions in Section 2.02) in the amount of such Reimbursement Amount, and the proceeds of such Borrowing may be applied to satisfy the Borrower’s obligations to such LC Issuing Bank or the Lenders, as the case may be. The Borrower’s obligation to pay any Reimbursement Amount in respect of Existing Letters of Credit shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">(e)If any LC Issuing Bank shall not have been reimbursed in full for any Reimbursement Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by such LC Issuing Bank on the date of such payment, such LC Issuing Bank shall give the Administrative Agent and each Lender prompt notice thereof (an “<hi rend="italic bold">LC Payment Notice</hi>”) no later than 12:00 noon (New York City Time) on the Business Day immediately succeeding the date of such payment by such LC Issuing Bank. Each Lender shall fund the participation that such Lender purchased pursuant to Section 2.04(a) by paying to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuing Bank an amount equal to such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such Reimbursement Amount paid by such LC Issuing Bank, plus interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate, for the first three days from the date of the payment by such LC Issuing Bank, and, thereafter, until the date of payment to such LC Issuing Bank by such Lender, at a rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. Each such payment by a Lender shall be made not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City Time) on the later to occur of (i) the Business Day immediately following the date of such payment by such LC Issuing Bank and (ii) the Business Day on which such Lender shall have received an LC Payment Notice from such LC Issuing Bank. Each Lender’s obligation to make each such payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuing Bank shall be several and shall not be affected by the occurrence or continuance of a Default or the failure of any other Lender to make any payment under this Section 2.04(e). Each Lender further agrees that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.</p><p style="text-align: right;">40</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(f)The failure of any Lender to make any payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of any LC Issuing Bank in accordance with subsection (e) above shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make payment, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender. If any Lender (a “<hi rend="italic bold">non-performing Lender</hi>”) shall fail to make any payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of any LC Issuing Bank in accordance with subsection (e) above, then for so long as such failure shall continue, such LC Issuing Bank shall be deemed, for purposes of Sections 6.01 and 8.01 hereof, to be a Lender owed a Borrowing in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount due and payable by such non-performing Lender to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuing Bank pursuant to subsection (e) above. Any non-performing Lender and the Borrower (without waiving any claim against such non-performing Lender for such non-performing Lender’s failure to fund its participation in the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower under subsection (e) above) severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuing Bank forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such non-performing Lender would have funded its participation had it complied with the requirements of subsection (e) above until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Base Rate Loans plus, if any amount paid by such LC Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit is not reimbursed by the Borrower within three Business Days, 2%, in accordance with Section 2.04(d), and (ii) in the case of such non-performing Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(g)The payment obligations of each Lender under Section 2.04(e) and of the Borrower under this Agreement in respect of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i)any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto or to such Letter of Credit;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(ii)any amendment or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, the terms of this Agreement or such Letter of Credit;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(iii)the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary, or any transferee, of such Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any LC Issuing Bank, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, thereby or by such Letter of Credit, or any unrelated transaction;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(iv)any statement or any other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;</p><p style="text-align: right;">41</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(v)payment in good faith by any LC Issuing Bank under the Letter of Credit issued by such LC Issuing Bank against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(vi)the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit by, or any act or omission of, the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for which the beneficiary may be acting); or </p><p style="text-align: justify;">(vii)any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(h)Without limiting any other provision of this Section 2.04, for purposes of this Section 2.04 any LC Issuing Bank may rely upon any oral, telephonic, telegraphic, facsimile, electronic, written or other communication believed in good faith to have been authorized by the Borrower, whether or not given or signed by an authorized Person of the Borrower.</p><p style="text-align: right;">42</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i)The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit.
