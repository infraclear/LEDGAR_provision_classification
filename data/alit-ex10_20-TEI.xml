                mean and are a reference to the Credit Agreement as modified by this Amendment. This
                Amendment is a Loan Document executed pursuant to the Credit Agreement and shall be
                construed, administered and applied in accordance with the terms and provisions
                thereof.</p>
            <p>(b) The Credit Agreement, as specifically amended by this Amendment, and each of the
                other Loan Documents are and shall continue to be in full force and effect and are
                hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed. Without limiting the generality of
                the foregoing, the Collateral Documents and all of the Collateral described therein
                do and shall continue to secure the payment of all Obligations including without
                limitation under the Credit Agreement as amended by this Amendment and the other
                Loan Documents.</p>
            <p>(c) The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment does not, except as
                expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any
                Lender or the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents nor constitute a
                waiver of any provision of any of the Loan Documents. This Amendment shall not
                constitute a novation of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Documents.</p>
            <p>Section 5.2. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts (and by
                different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute
                an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
                contract. This Amendment constitutes the entire contract among the parties relating
                to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all previous agreements and
                understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This
                Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
                to the other Loan Documents and their respective successors and assigns. This
                Amendment may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using
                Electronic Signatures (including, without limitation, facsimile and “pdf”) and shall
                be considered an original, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and
                enforceability as a paper record. This Amendment and any document, amendment,
                approval, consent, information, notice,</p>
            <p>-10-</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph">certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization
                related to this Amendment (each a “Communication”), may be executed in as many
                counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic
                counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Amendment. For the
                avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, without
                limitation, use or acceptance by any of the parties hereto of a manually signed
                paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned
                into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication converted into another
                format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. For purposes hereof,
                “Electronic Record” and “Electronic Signature” shall have the meanings assigned to
                them, respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time.</p>
            <p>Section 5.3. GOVERNING LAW, etc. This AMENDMENT shall be construed in ACCORDANCE with
                and governed by the law of the State of New York. The provisions of Sections
                10.15(b) and 10.16 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein and apply to this
                Amendment mutatis mutandis.</p>
            <p>Section 5.4. Headings. Article and Section headings used herein are for convenience
                of reference only, are not part of this Amendment and are not to affect the
                construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Amendment.</p>
            <p>Section 5.5. Reaffirmation. Each Loan Party hereby expressly acknowledges the terms
                of this Amendment and reaffirms, as of the date hereof, (i) the covenants and
                agreements contained in each Loan Document to which it is a party, including, in
                each case, such covenants and agreements as in effect immediately after giving
                effect to this Amendment and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) its
                guarantee of the Obligations under each Guaranty, and its prior grant of security
                interest and pledge under the Collateral Documents and each Loan Document and
                confirms that the Liens on the Collateral, security interests and pledges granted
                pursuant to the Collateral Documents and each Loan Document continue in full force
                and effect after giving effect to this Amendment and secure the Obligations,
                including without limitation, any additional Obligations resulting from or incurred
                pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Amendment.</p>

                subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition, at or prior to the consummation of

                Interest Expense for purposes of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio will be
                calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin
                contained in any financing commitment documentation with respect to such
                Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably
                determined by the Borrower in good faith).</p>

                action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Borrower, be
                deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified Event of
                Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive agreements for such
                Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
                Borrower has exercised its option under this clause (h), and any Default, Event of
                Default or specified Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive
                agreements for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition were entered into and

                compliance shall be measured at the time when the relevant event is undertaken, as
                such financial ratios and metrics are intended to be “incurrence” tests and not

                specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period
                of one (1) month. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated
                in another Approved Currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original Approved
                Currency or reborrowed in another Approved Currency.</p>

            <p>(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each L/C Issuer agrees, in
                reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this
                ‎Section 2.03, from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
                Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date to issue Letters of Credit
                at sight denominated in any Approved Currency for the account of the Borrower or any
                Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower and to amend or renew Letters of Credit
                previously issued by it, in accordance with ‎Section 2.03(b), and to honor drafts
                under the Letters of Credit and the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to
                participate in Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this ‎Section 2.03; provided
                that no L/C Issuer shall be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect
                to any Letter of Credit, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any
                Letter of Credit if as of the date of such L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Revolving
                Credit Exposure of any Revolving Credit Lender would exceed such Lender’s Revolving
                Credit Commitment, (y) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in respect of
                Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer would exceed such L/C Issuer’s L/C
                Commitment or (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the
                Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and
                conditions hereof, the Borrower’s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully
                revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain
                Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been
                drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be
                issued hereunder in the name of the Borrower for the benefit of the Borrower or
                Subsidiary of the Borrower in whose name such Existing Letter of Credit is
                outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date and shall constitute Letters of
                Credit subject to the terms hereof.</p>
            <p>(ii) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:</p>
            <p>(A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall
                by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter
                of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any directive (whether or not
                having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such
                L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or direct that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance
                of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall
                impose upon such L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
                reserve or capital requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise
                compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such
                L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the
                Closing Date (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder);</p>
            <p>109</p>

            <p>(B) subject to ‎Section 2.03(b)(iii) and ‎Section 2.03(a)(ii)(C), the expiry date of
                such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date
                of issuance or last renewal, unless each Appropriate Lender has approved of such
                expiration date or the L/C Issuer thereof has approved of such expiration date and
                the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations in respect of such requested Letter of
                Credit has been Cash Collateralized or backstopped pursuant to arrangements
                reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer;</p>
            <p>(C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter
                of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the Revolving Credit Lenders have approved
                such expiry date;</p>
            <p>(D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any Laws binding upon such
                L/C Issuer;</p>
            <p>(E) the L/C Issuer does not as of the issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit
                issue Letters of Credit in the requested currency or type; or</p>
            <p>(F) any Revolving Credit Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such L/C
                Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral,
                satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such
                Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after
                giving effect to ‎Section 2.17(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising
                from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit
                and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential
                Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.</p>
            <p>(iii) An L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if
                such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit
                in its amended form under the terms hereof, or the beneficiary of such Letter of
                Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.</p>
            <p>(iv) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters
                of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each L/C Issuer
                shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative
                Agent in Article 9 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C
                Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by
                it and any Letter of Credit Issuance Request (and any other document, agreement or
                instrument entered into by such L/C Issuer and the Borrower or in favor of such L/C
                Issuer) pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative
                Agent” as used in Article 9 included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or
                omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to each L/C
                Issuer.</p>

            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>(v) The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, reduce the L/C Commitment of
                any L/C Issuer with the consent of such L/C Issuer; provided that the Borrower shall
                not reduce the L/C Commitment of any L/C Issuer if, after giving effect to such
                reduction, the conditions set forth in clause (i) above would not be satisfied.</p>
            <p>(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension
                Letters of Credit.</p>
            <p>(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the
                request of the Borrower delivered to an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the
                Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Issuance Request,
                appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower or
                his/her delegate or designee. Such Letter of Credit Issuance Request must be
                received by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00
                p.m. (New York City time) at least two Business Days prior to the proposed issuance
                date or date of amendment, as the case may be; or, in each case, such other date and
                time as the relevant L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole
                discretion. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit,
                such Letter of Credit Issuance Request shall specify in form and detail reasonably
                satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer: the proposed issuance date of the requested
                Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); the amount thereof; the expiry
                date thereof; the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; the documents to be
                presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; the full text of
                any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
                thereunder; the relevant Approved Currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be
                denominated; and such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer may reasonably
                request. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of
                Credit, such Letter of Credit Issuance Request shall specify in form and detail
                reasonably satisfactory to the relevant L/C Issuer the Letter of Credit to be
                amended; the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); the
                nature of the proposed amendment; and such other matters as the relevant L/C Issuer
                may reasonably request.</p>
            <p>(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Issuance Request, the relevant
                L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)
                that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Issuance
                Request from the Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the
                Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the relevant L/C Issuer of
                confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment
                is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and
                conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of
                Credit for the account of the Borrower or, if applicable, the Restricted Subsidiary,
                or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the
                issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to,
                and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the relevant L/C
                Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit</p>
            <p>111</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share provided for under
                this Agreement times the amount of such Letter of Credit.</p>
            <p>(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Issuance
                Request, the relevant L/C Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has
                automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”);
                provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the relevant L/C
                Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve month period
                (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior
                notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a number of days (the
                “Non-Extension Notice Date”) prior to the last day of such twelve month period to be
                agreed upon by the relevant L/C Issuer and the Borrower at the time such Letter of
                Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the relevant L/C Issuer, the Borrower
                shall not be required to make a specific request to the relevant L/C Issuer for any
                such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the
                applicable Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the
                relevant L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to
                an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided that
                the relevant L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if the relevant L/C
                Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such
                Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (by reason of the
                provisions of ‎Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or it has received notice (which
                may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business
                Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any
                Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable
                conditions specified in ‎Section 4.02 is not then satisfied.</p>
            <p>(iv) Promptly after issuance of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of
                Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the
                Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or
                amendment.</p>
            <p>(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.</p>
            <p>(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a
                drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall notify promptly
                the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit
                denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C
                Issuer in such Approved Foreign Currency, unless the L/C Issuer (at its option)
                shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars.
                In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of
                Credit denominated in an Approved Foreign Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the
                Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following
                the determination thereof. Not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time), in the
                case of a drawing in Dollars, or 2:00 p.m. (London time) (or, if earlier, 9:00 a.m.
                New York city time), in the case of a drawing in an Approved Foreign Currency, on
                (1) the next Business Day immediately following the date of any</p>

            <p>honoring of a drawing by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit that the Borrower
                receives notice thereof (each such date, an “Honor Date”), the Borrower shall
                reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the
                amount of such drawing in the relevant Approved Currency; provided that the Borrower
                may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance
                with this ‎Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a Revolving Credit
                Borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility or a Swing Line Borrowing under the
                Swing Line Facility in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
                Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the
                resulting Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as applicable. If the
                Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, such L/C Issuer shall
                notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
                each Appropriate Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing
                (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof) (the
                “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the amount of such Appropriate Lender’s Pro Rata Share
                provided for under this Agreement thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be
                deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be
                disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without
                regard to the minimum and multiples specified in ‎Section 2.02 for the principal
                amount of Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, but subject to
                the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the
                Appropriate Lenders and the conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 (other than the
                delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the
                Administrative Agent pursuant to this ‎Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone
                if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate
                confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such
                notice.</p>
            <p>(ii) Each Appropriate Lender (including any Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall
                upon any notice pursuant to ‎Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the
                Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer in Dollars at the
                Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to
                its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of
                the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
                Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon,
                subject to the provisions of ‎Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Appropriate Lender that so
                makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan that is a
                Base Rate Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan, as applicable, to the Borrower in such
                amount. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit the funds so received to the
                relevant L/C Issuer in Dollars.</p>
            <p>(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a
                Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as
                applicable, because the conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or
                for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the
                relevant L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that
                is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand</p>

                each Appropriate Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
                relevant L/C Issuer pursuant to ‎Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in
                respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C
                Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
                ‎Section 2.03.</p>
            <p>(iv) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance
                pursuant to this ‎Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer for any
                amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s Pro
                Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such
                amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer.</p>

                Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as
                contemplated by this ‎Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
                not be affected by any circumstance, including any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,
                defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L/C Issuer,
                the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, the occurrence or
                continuance of a Default, or any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or
                not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lender’s
                obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this ‎Section 2.03(c) is
                subject to the conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the
                Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve
                or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the relevant L/C
                Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of
                Credit, together with interest as provided herein.</p>
            <p>(vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
                Agent for the account of the relevant L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by
                such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this ‎Section 2.03(c) by the
                time specified in ‎Section 2.03(c)(ii), such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover
                from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount
                with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the
                date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per
                annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate from time to time in effect, plus any
                reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such
                L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the relevant L/C
                Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent)
                with respect to any amounts owing under this ‎Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be
                conclusive absent manifest error.</p>

            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>(i) If, at any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit
                and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender’s L/C Advance in
                respect of such payment in accordance with ‎Section 2.03(c), the Administrative
                Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the
                related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower
                or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
                Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its
                Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement hereof
                (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of
                time during which such Lender’s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as
                those received by the Administrative Agent.</p>
            <p>(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C
                Issuer pursuant to ‎Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the
                circumstances described in ‎Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
                entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall
                pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Pro Rata
                Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand
                of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to
                the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the
                Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or
                similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the
                foregoing.</p>
            <p>(iii) On the Amendment No. 5 Effective Date, the participations in any outstanding
                Letters of Credit shall be reallocated so that after giving effect thereto the
                Non-Extended Revolving Credit Lenders and the Extended Revolving Credit Lenders
                shall share ratably in the L/C Obligations in accordance with their respective Pro
                Rata Share of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (including both the
                Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the Extended Revolving Credit
                Commitments from time to time in effect). Thereafter, until the Maturity Date with
                respect to the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Facility, the participations in any new
                Letters of Credit shall be allocated ratably in accordance with the Revolving Credit
                Lenders’ respective Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments
                (including both the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the Extended
                Revolving Credit Commitments). On the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended
                Revolving Credit Facility, the participations in the outstanding Letters of Credit
                of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Lenders shall be reallocated to the Extended
                Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share of the
                Extended Revolving Credit Commitments but in any case, only to the extent that (x)
                the sum of the participations in the outstanding Letters of Credit of the
                Non-Extended Revolving Credit Lenders and Extended Revolving Credit Lenders does not
                exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit at such time and (y) such sum plus the
                aggregate Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans does not
                exceed the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments at such time.</p>

            <p>(iv) If the reallocation described in clause (iii) above cannot, or can only
                partially, be effected as a result of the limitations set forth herein, the Borrower
                shall, on the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended Revolving Credit
                Facility, Cash Collateralize any such Letters of Credit in an amount equal to 100%
                of the L/C Obligations that are not so reallocated.</p>

                L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay
                each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
                paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all

                such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such
                transferee may be acting), the relevant L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in
                connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
                Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated

                Dollars or the relevant Approved Foreign Currency to the Borrower or any Subsidiary
                or in the relevant currency markets generally; and</p>

            <p>(vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
                of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a
                defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party;</p>
            <p>provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L/C Issuer from liability to the
                Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages,
                claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
                applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such L/C Issuer’s gross
                negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable
                judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction when determining whether drafts and
                other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
                thereof.</p>
            <p>(f) Role of L/C Issuers. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any
                drawing under a Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall not have any
                responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and
                documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as
                to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person
                executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuers, any
                Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or
                assignees of any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
                omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or
                the Lenders holding a majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable;
                any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct
                as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
                jurisdiction; or the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any
                document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Issuance
                Request. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
                beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided
                that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s
                pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
                transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuers, any
                Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or
                assignees of any L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters
                described in clauses ‎(i) through ‎(vii) of ‎Section 2.03(e) or any error, omission,
                interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
                other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
                document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
                technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such
                L/C Issuer; provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding,
                the Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be
                liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
                opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which are
                caused by such L/C Issuer’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts
                and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
                thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of willful
                misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the relevant L/C Issuer or such L/C
                Issuer’s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
                after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s)
                strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit, in each
                case, as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
                jurisdiction, such L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each</p>
            <p>117</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>such determination. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C
                Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
                responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to
                the contrary, and no L/C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency
                of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
                Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole
                or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason, or refuse
                to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in
                compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.</p>
            <p>(g) Cash Collateral. If as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of
                Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn (and
                without limiting the requirements of ‎Section 2.03(a)(ii)(C)), any Event of Default
                occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Lenders holding a
                majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, require the Borrower to
                Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to ‎Section 8.02 or an Event of
                Default set forth under ‎Section 8.01(f) occurs and is continuing, the Borrower
                shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (in an
                amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of
                Default or the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do
                so not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time on (x) in the case of the
                immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the Business Day that the Borrower
                receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12:00 noon,
                New York City time or if clause ‎(1) above does not apply, the Business Day
                immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice and (y) in the
                case of the immediately preceding clause ‎(iii), the Business Day on which an Event
                of Default set forth under ‎Section 8.01(f) occurs or, if such day is not a Business
                Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. At any time that there shall
                exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
                the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the
                Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting
                Exposure (after giving effect to ‎Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral
                provided by the Defaulting Lender). For purposes hereof, “Cash Collateralize” means
                to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit
                of the relevant L/C Issuer and the Appropriate Lenders, as collateral for the L/C
                Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (“Cash Collateral”) pursuant to
                documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
                Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the
                Appropriate Lenders). Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The
                Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
                Issuers and the Revolving Credit Lenders of the applicable Facility, a security
                interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all
                proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a Cash Collateral
                Account and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents as directed by the
                Borrower. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as
                Cash Collateral are expressly subject to any right or claim of any Person other than
                the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount
                of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,
                the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the
                Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the Cash
                Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a)</p>
            <p>118</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then
                held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be
                free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit
                for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to
                the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L/C Issuer. To
                the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of
                such L/C Obligations and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
                continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. To the extent any Event of
                Default giving rise to the requirement to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit
                pursuant to this ‎Section 2.03(g) is cured or otherwise waived by the Required
                Lenders, then so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
                all Cash Collateral pledged to Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit shall be
                refunded to the Borrower.</p>
            <p>(h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
                account of the Revolving Credit Lenders for the applicable Revolving Credit Facility
                (in accordance with their Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for
                under this Agreement of the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Facility or Extended
                Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable) a Letter of Credit fee in Dollars for each
                Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate for
                Revolving Credit Loans times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily maximum amount then
                available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum
                amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum amount
                increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit); provided,
                however, any Letter of Credit fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting
                Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has
                not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this
                ‎Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law,
                to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective
                Pro Rata Shares allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to ‎Section 2.17(a)(iv),
                with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account.
                Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such
                Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable in Dollars on the last Business Day
                of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to
                occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit
                Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in any Applicable
                Rate for Revolving Credit Loans during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each
                Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by such Applicable Rate separately
                for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.</p>
            <p>(i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. The
                Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, a
                fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it equal to 0.125% per
                annum of the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate face amount of such Letter of
                Credit. Such fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such
                fronting fees shall be due and payable in Dollars on the last Business Day of each
                March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur
                after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date
                and thereafter on demand. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C
                Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, with</p>
            <p>119</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it the customary issuance, presentation,
                amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such
                L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such
                customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable within ten (10)
                Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable.</p>
            <p>(j) Conflict with Letter of Credit Issuance Request. Notwithstanding anything else to
                the contrary in this Agreement or any Letter of Credit Issuance Request, in the
                event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
                Issuance Request, the terms hereof shall control.</p>
            <p>(k) Addition of an L/C Issuer. A Revolving Credit Lender may become an additional L/C
                Issuer hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the
                Administrative Agent and such Revolving Credit Lender. The Administrative Agent
                shall notify the Revolving Credit Lenders of any such additional L/C Issuer.</p>
            <p>(l) Letter of Credit Amounts. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a
                Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the
                stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however,
                that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any
                document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated
                amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar
                Equivalent of the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect
                to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at
                such time.</p>
            <p>(m) Reporting. Each L/C Issuer will report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i)
                on the first Business Day of each calendar month, the aggregate face amount of
                Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the last Business Day of the
                preceding calendar month (and on such other dates as the Administrative Agent may
                request), (ii) on or prior to each Business Day on which such L/C Issuer expects to
                issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance or
                amendment, and the aggregate face amount of Letters of Credit to be issued, amended,
                renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance,
                amendment, renewal or extension (and such L/C Issuer shall advise the Administrative
                Agent on such Business Day whether such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
                occurred and whether the amount thereof changed), (iii) on each Business Day on
                which such L/C Issuer makes any L/C Disbursement, the date and amount of such L/C
                Disbursement and (iv) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse
                an L/C Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such L/C Issuer on such day, the
                date and amount of such failure.</p>
            <p>(n) Provisions Related to Letters of Credit in respect of Extending Revolving Credit
                Commitments. If the Letter of Credit Expiration Date in respect of any tranche of
                Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiry date of any Letter of
                Credit, then if consented to by the L/C Issuer which issued such Letter of Credit,
                if one or more other tranches of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which
                the Letter of Credit Expiration Date shall not have so occurred are then in effect,
                such Letters of Credit for which consent has been obtained shall automatically be
                deemed to have been issued</p>
            <p>120</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>(including for purposes of the obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders to
                purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Credit Loans and payments in
                respect thereof pursuant to ‎Sections 2.03(c) and ‎(d)) under (and ratably
                participated in by Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect
                of such non-terminating tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the
                aggregate amount of the unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments thereunder at such
                time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be
                so reallocated) and to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding
                clause ‎(i), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in
                accordance with ‎Section 2.03(g). Upon the maturity date of any tranche of Revolving
                Credit Commitments, the sublimit for Letters of Credit may be reduced as agreed
                between the L/C Issuers and the Borrower, without the consent of any other
                Person.</p>
            <p>(o) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of
                Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is
                for the account of, a Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to
                reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such
                Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of
                Credit for the account of Restricted Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the
                Borrower, and that the Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the
                businesses of such Restricted Subsidiaries. In the event that the Borrower requests
                any Letter of Credit to be issued for the benefit or account of a Restricted
                Subsidiary, such Restricted Subsidiary shall deliver documentation (including,
                without limitation, customary letter of credit requests and reimbursement
                agreements) as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the
                applicable L/C Issuer.</p>
            <p>(p) Provisions Related to Extending Revolving Credit Commitments. In connection with
                the establishment of any Extending Revolving Credit Commitments or Other Revolving
                Credit Commitments and subject to the availability of unused Commitments with
                respect to such Class and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
                4.02, the Borrower may with the written consent of the applicable L/C Issuer
                designate any outstanding Letter of Credit to be a Letter of Credit issued pursuant
                to such Class of Extending Revolving Credit Commitments or Other Revolving Credit
                Commitments. Upon such designation such Letter of Credit shall no longer be deemed
                to be issued and outstanding under such prior Class and shall instead be deemed to
                be issued and outstanding under such Class of Extending Revolving Credit Commitments
                or Other Revolving Credit Commitments.</p>
            <p>(q) Replacement of an L/C Issuer. An L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by
                written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C
                Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall notify the
                Lenders of any such replacement of an L/C Issuer. From and after the effective date
                of any such replacement, (x) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and
                obligations of the L/C Issuer being replaced under this Agreement with respect to
                Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (y) references herein to the term “L/C
                Issuer” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous L/C Issuer, or
                to such successor and all current and previous L/C Issuers, as the context shall
                require. After the replacement of an L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer
                shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have</p>
            <p>121</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to
                Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required
                to issue additional Letters of Credit.</p>
            <p>(r) Resignation of an L/C Issuer. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
                successor L/C Issuer, any L/C Issuer may resign as an L/C Issuer at any time upon
                thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the
                Lenders, in which case, such L/C Issuer shall be replaced in accordance with Section
                2.03(q) above.</p>
            <p>(s) Existing Letters of Credit. The parties hereto agree that the Existing Letters of
                Credit shall be deemed Letters of Credit for all purposes under this Agreement,
                without any further action by the Borrower.</p>
            <p>Section 2.04. Swing Line Loans</p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p>The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Bank of
                America, in its capacity as Swing Line Lender, agrees to make loans in Dollars to
                the Borrower (each such loan, a “Swing Line Loan”), from time to time on any
                Business Day during the period beginning on the Business Day after the Closing Date
                and until the Maturity Date of the Extended Revolving Credit Facility in an
                aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the
                Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when
                aggregated with the Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this
                Agreement of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of
                the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Swing Line
                Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that, after giving effect to any
                Swing Line Loan, (x) the Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the aggregate
                Revolving Credit Commitments and (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the
                Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender’s Pro Rata Share or other
                applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the Outstanding Amount of all
                L/C Obligations, plus such Lender’s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share
                provided for under this Agreement of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans
                shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect; provided,
                further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to
                refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject
                to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this
                ‎Section 2.04, prepay under ‎Section 2.05, and reborrow under this ‎Section 2.04.
                Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a
                Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
                irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a
                risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such
                Lender’s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement
                times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.</p>
            <p>On the Amendment No. 5 Effective Date, the participations in any outstanding Swing
                Line Loans shall be reallocated so that after giving effect thereto the
                Non-Extended</p>

            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>Revolving Credit Lenders and the Extended Revolving Credit Lenders shall share
                ratably in the outstanding Swing Line Loans in accordance with their respective Pro
                Rata Share of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (including both the
                Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the Extended Revolving Credit
                Commitments from time to time in effect). Thereafter, until the Maturity Date with
                respect to the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Facility, the participations in any new
                Swing Line Loans shall be allocated ratably in accordance with the Revolving Credit
                Lenders’ respective Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments
                (including both the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and the Extended
                Revolving Credit Commitments). On the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended
                Revolving Credit Facility all then outstanding Swing Line Loans shall be repaid in
                full (and there shall be no adjustment to the participations in such Swing Line
                Loans as a result of the occurrence of such Maturity Date); provided, however, that
                if, and only to the extent that, on the Maturity Date with respect to the
                Non-Extended Revolving Credit Facility (after giving effect to any repayments of
                Revolving Credit Loans and any reallocation of Letter of Credit participations as
                contemplated in Section 2.03(d)(iii)), there shall exist sufficient unutilized
                Extended Revolving Credit Commitments so that all or a portion of the then
                outstanding Swing Line Loans could be incurred pursuant the Extended Revolving
                Credit Commitments and in compliance with the Swing Line Sublimit, then there shall
                be an automatic adjustment on the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended
                Revolving Credit Facility of the participations in such Swing Line Loans, the same
                shall be deemed to have been incurred solely pursuant to the Extended Revolving
                Credit Commitments, and such Swing Line Loans shall not be so required to be repaid
                in full on the Maturity Date with respect to the Non-Extended Revolving Credit
                Facility.</p>
            <p>(b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower’s
                irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may
                be given by telephone or Swing Line Loan Notice. Each such notice must be received
                by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. New
                York City time on the requested borrowing date and shall specify the principal
                amount to be borrowed, which principal amount shall be a minimum of $500,000 (and
                any amount in excess of $500,000 shall be in integral multiples of $100,000) and the
                requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice
                must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the
                Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed
                and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the
                Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice (by telephone or in writing), the
                Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
                writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice
                and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by
                telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has
                received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent
                (including at the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. New
                York City time on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing directing the Swing
                Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set
                forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of ‎Section 2.04(a), or that one or
                more of the applicable conditions specified in ‎Section 4.02 is not then satisfied,
                then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not
                later than 3:00 p.m. New</p>

            <p>York City time on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make
                the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower at its office by
                crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in
                immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
                this ‎Section 2.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Swing Line Lender shall not
                be obligated to make any Swing Line Loan at a time when a Revolving Credit Lender is
                a Defaulting Lender unless the Swing Line Lender has entered into arrangements
                reasonably satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swing Line Lender’s
                Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to ‎Section 2.17(a)(iv)) with respect to the
                Defaulting Lender’s or Defaulting Lenders’ participation in such Swing Line Loans,
                including by Cash Collateralizing, or obtaining a backstop letter of credit from an
                issuer reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Line Lender to support, such Defaulting
                Lender’s or Defaulting Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Swing Line
                Loans.</p>
            <p>(c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.</p>
            <p>(i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may
                request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes such Swing
                Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a
                Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender’s Pro Rata Share or other
                applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the amount of Swing Line Loans
                then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall
                be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with
                the requirements of ‎Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples
                specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the
                unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions
                set forth in ‎Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a
                copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice
                to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal
                to its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of
                the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative
                Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the
                Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00
                p.m. New York City time on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice,
                whereupon, subject to ‎Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so
                makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower
                in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the
                Swing Line Lender.</p>
            <p>(ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving
                Credit Borrowing in accordance with ‎Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate
                Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a
                request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its
                risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit
                Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line
                Lender pursuant to ‎Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such
                participation.</p>

            <p>(iii) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative
                Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by the
                Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this ‎Section 2.04(c) by the time
                specified in ‎Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover
                from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount
                with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the
                date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a
                rate per annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate from time to time in effect,
                plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged
                by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the
                Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with
                respect to any amounts owing under this clause ‎(iii) shall be conclusive absent
                manifest error.</p>
            <p>(iv) Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to
                purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this ‎Section
                2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
                circumstance, including any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
                which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other
                Person for any reason whatsoever, the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or any
                other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
                foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving
                Credit Loans pursuant to this ‎Section 2.04(c) (but not to purchase and fund risk
                participations in Swing Line Loans) is subject to the conditions set forth in
                ‎Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise
                impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with
                interest as provided herein.</p>
            <p>(d) Repayment of Participations.</p>
            <p>(i) At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk
                participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on
                account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such
                Lender its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this
                Agreement of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments,
                to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s risk participation was
                funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.</p>
            <p>(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or
                interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender
                under any of the circumstances described in ‎Section 10.06 (including pursuant to
                any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each
                Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share or
                other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand of the
                Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date
                such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds</p>
            <p>125</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>Effective Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of
                the Swing Line Lender.</p>
            <p>(e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be
                responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until
                each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan, Eurocurrency Rate Loan or
                risk participation pursuant to this ‎Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender’s Pro
                Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall
                be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.</p>
            <p>(f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of
                principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line
                Lender.</p>
            <p>(g) Provisions Related to Extending Revolving Credit Commitments. If the maturity
                date shall have occurred in respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments
                (the “Expiring Credit Commitment”) at a time when another tranche or tranches of
                Revolving Credit Commitments is or are in effect with a longer maturity date (each a
                “Non-Expiring Credit Commitment” and collectively, the “Non-Expiring Credit
                Commitments”), then with respect to each outstanding Swing Line Loan, if consented
                to by the applicable Swing Line Lender, on the earliest occurring maturity date such
                Swing Line Loan shall be deemed reallocated to the tranche or tranches of the
                Non-Expiring Credit Commitments on a pro rata basis; provided that (x) to the extent
                that the amount of such reallocation would cause the aggregate credit exposure to
                exceed the aggregate amount of such Non-Expiring Credit Commitments, immediately
                prior to such reallocation the amount of Swing Line Loans to be reallocated equal to
                such excess shall be repaid or Cash Collateralized and (y) notwithstanding the
                foregoing, if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
                Borrower shall still be obligated to pay Swing Line Loans allocated to the Revolving
                Credit Lenders holding the Expiring Credit Commitments at the maturity date of the
                Expiring Credit Commitment or if the Loans have been accelerated prior to the
                maturity date of the Expiring Credit Commitment. Upon the maturity date of any
                tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments, the sublimit for Swing Line Loans may be
                reduced as agreed between the Swing Line Lender and the Borrower, without the
                consent of any other Person.</p>
            <p>(h) Replacement of the Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender may be replaced at
                any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
                replaced Swing Line Lender and the successor Swing Line Lender. The Administrative
                Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of a Swing Line Lender. From
                and after the effective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Swing Line
                Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Swing Line Lender
                under this Agreement with respect to Swing Line Loans made thereafter and (y)
                references herein to the term “Swing Line Lender” shall be deemed to refer to such
                successor or to any previous Swing Line Lender, or to such successor and all
                previous Swing Line Lenders, as the context shall require. After the replacement of
                a Swing Line Lender hereunder, the replaced Swing Line Lender shall remain a party
                hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations</p>
            <p>126</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>of a Swing Line Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swing Line Loans made by
                it prior to its replacement, but shall not be required to make additional Swing Line
                Loans.</p>
            <p>(i) Resignation of the Swing Line Lender. Subject to the appointment and acceptance
                of a successor Swing Line Lender, the Swing Line Lender may resign as a Swing Line
                Lender at any time upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative
                Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such Swing Line Lender shall be
                replaced in accordance with Section 2.04(h) above.</p>
            <p>Section 2.05. Prepayments</p>
            <p>. Optional.</p>
            <p>(i) The Borrower may, upon, subject to clause ‎(iii) below, written notice to the
                Administrative Agent by the Borrower, at any time or from time to time voluntarily
                prepay Term Loans of any Class and Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part
                without premium or penalty (subject to Section 2.05(a)(iv)); provided that (1) such
                notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. New
                York City time three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency
                Rate Loans, two Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Loans and
                one Business Day prior to any prepayment of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans, in
                each case, unless the Administrative Agent agrees to a shorter period in its
                discretion; any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans shall be in
                a minimum Principal Amount of $1,000,000, or a whole multiple of $250,000 in excess
                thereof; and any prepayment of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans shall be in a
                minimum Principal Amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess
                thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire Principal Amount thereof then
                outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment
                and the Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid; provided that from the
                Amendment No. 5 Effective Date until the Maturity Date with respect to the
                Non-Extended Revolving Credit Facility, all Revolving Credit Loans shall be prepaid
                on a pro rata basis between the Non-Extended Revolving Credit Facility and the
                Extended Revolving Credit Facility. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify
                each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of
                such Lender’s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this
                Agreement of such prepayment. Subject to Section 2.05(iii) below, if such notice is
                given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment
                amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified
                therein. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term SOFR Loan shall be
                accompanied by all accrued interest thereon to such date, together with, in the case
                of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, any additional amounts required pursuant to ‎Section
                3.05. In the case of each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this ‎Section 2.05(a),
                the Borrower may in its sole discretion select the Borrowing or Borrowings (and the
                order of maturity of principal payments) to be repaid, and such payment shall be
                paid to the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares
                or other applicable share as provided for under this Agreement.</p>
            <p>127</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>(ii) The Borrower may, upon, subject to clause ‎(iii) below, written notice to the
                Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from
                time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without
                premium or penalty; provided that such notice must be received by the Swing Line
                Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on
                the date of the prepayment, and any such prepayment shall be in a minimum Principal
                Amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, if less,
                the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify
                the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the
                Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice
                shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.</p>
            <p>(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, subject
                to the payment of any amounts owing pursuant to ‎Section 3.05, the Borrower may
                rescind any notice of prepayment under Sections ‎2.05(a)(i) or ‎2.05(a)(ii) if such
                prepayment would have resulted from a refinancing of all or a portion of the
                applicable Facility, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise
                be delayed. Each prepayment of any Class of Term Loans pursuant to this ‎Section
                2.05(a) shall be applied in an order of priority to repayments thereof required
                pursuant to ‎Section 2.07(a) as directed by the Borrower (which may be applied to
                any specific Class, tranche or facility of Indebtedness) and, absent such direction,
                shall be applied in direct order of maturity to repayments thereof required pursuant
                to ‎Section 2.07(a).</p>
            <p>(iv) In the event that, on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the Amendment No.
                7 Effective Date, the Borrower (x) prepays, refinances, substitutes or replaces any
                Initial Term B-1 Loans (including the Incremental Term B-1 Loans) pursuant to a

                effects any amendment, amendment and restatement or other modification of this
                Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction, the Borrower shall pay to the
                Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Term B-1
                Lenders, in the case of clause (x), a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the aggregate
                principal amount of the Initial Term B-1 Loans (including the Incremental Term B-1

                Term Loan Prepayment”), in each case made in accordance with this ‎Section
                2.05(a)(v); provided that no Company Party shall initiate any action under this
                ‎Section 2.05(a)(v) in order to make a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment unless (I) at
                least ten (10) Business Days shall have passed since the consummation of the most

                no Term Lender was willing to accept any prepayment of any Term Loan at the
                Specified Discount, within the Discount Range or at any discount to par value, as

                Prepayment Response to be completed and returned by each such Term Lender to the

                Accepting Lender”), the amount and the tranches of such Lender’s Term Loans to be
                prepaid at such offered discount. Each acceptance of a Discounted Term Loan
                Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender shall be irrevocable. Any Term
                Lender whose Specified Discount Prepayment Response is not received by the Auction
                Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have
                declined to accept the applicable Borrower Offer of Specified Discount
                Prepayment.</p>
            <p>(2) If there is at least one Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the relevant
                Company Party will make a prepayment of outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this

                such Company Party, to (x) each Term Lender and/or (y) each Term Lender with respect
                to any Class of Term Loans on an individual tranche basis, (II) any such notice

                Range”) of the principal amount of such Term Loans with respect to each relevant
                tranche of Term Loans willing to be prepaid by such Company Party (it being
                understood that different Discount Ranges and/or Discount Range Prepayment Amounts
                may be offered with respect to different tranches of Term Loans and, in such event,
                each such offer will be treated as a separate offer pursuant to the terms of this

                shall remain outstanding through the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date. The
                Auction Agent will promptly provide each Appropriate Lender with a copy of such
                Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of the Discount Range Prepayment Offer
                to be submitted by a responding Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no

                of delivery of such notice to such Lenders (the “Discount Range Prepayment Response
                Date”). Each Term Lender’s Discount Range Prepayment Offer shall be irrevocable and
                shall specify a discount to par within the Discount Range (the “Submitted Discount”)
                at which such Lender is willing to allow prepayment of any or</p>

                “Submitted Amount”) such Term Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Submitted

                have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment of any of its Term Loans
                at any discount to their par value within the Discount Range.</p>
            <p>(2) The Auction Agent shall review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received on
                or before the applicable Discount Range Prepayment Response Date and shall determine
                (in consultation with such Company Party and subject to rounding requirements of the
                Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) the Applicable Discount and
                Term Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in accordance with this
                subsection (C). The relevant Company Party agrees to accept on the Discount Range
                Prepayment Response Date all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by Auction
                Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date, in the order from the
                Submitted Discount that is the largest discount to par to the Submitted Discount
                that is the smallest discount to par, up to and including the Submitted Discount

                Discount that is the smallest discount to par within the Discount Range being
                referred to as the “Applicable Discount”) which yields a Discounted Term Loan
                Prepayment in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lower of (I) the Discount
                Range Prepayment Amount and (II) the sum of all Submitted Amounts. Each Term Lender
                that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at a
                discount to par that is larger than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be
                deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal to its
                Submitted Amount (subject to any required proration pursuant to the following
                subsection ‎(3)) at the Applicable Discount (each such Term Lender, a “Participating

                Amount by all Participating Lenders offered at a discount to par greater than or
                equal to the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discount Range Prepayment Amount,

                accordance with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified Participating Lender
                and the Auction Agent (in consultation with such Company Party and subject to
                rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion)
                will calculate such proration (the “Discount Range Proration”). The Auction Agent
                shall promptly, and in any case within five (5) Business Days following the Discount

                Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the
                aggregate principal amount and tranches of Term Loans to be prepaid at the
                Applicable Discount on such date, (III) each Participating Lender of the aggregate

                Discount on such date, and (IV) if applicable, each Identified Participating Lender
                of the Discount Range Proration. Each determination by the Auction Agent of the
                amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the relevant Company Party and Term
                Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The
                payment amount specified in such notice to the Company Party shall be due and

            <p>(D) Subject to the proviso to subsection ‎(A) above, any Company Party may from time
                to time solicit Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction
                Agent with five (5) Business Days’ notice in the form of a Solicited Discounted

                Lender with respect to any Class of Term Loans on an individual tranche basis, (II)
                any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Term
                Loans (the “Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount”) and the tranche or tranches of

                City time), on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to
                such Term Lenders (the “Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date”). Each Term
                Lender’s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer shall (x) be irrevocable, (y) remain
                outstanding until the Acceptance Date, and (z) specify both a discount to par (the

                of such Term Loans (the “Offered Amount”) such Term Lender is willing to have

            <p>(2) The Auction Agent shall promptly provide the relevant Company Party with a copy
                of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received on or before the Solicited
                Discounted Prepayment Response Date. Such Company Party shall review all such

                Discounted Prepayment Offers that is acceptable to the Company Party (the

                Discount as the Acceptable Discount, then as soon as practicable after the
                determination of the Acceptable Discount, but in no event later than by the third
                Business Day after the date of receipt by such Company Party from the Auction Agent
                of a copy of all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers pursuant to the first
                sentence of this subsection ‎(2) (the “Acceptance Date”), the Company Party shall
                submit an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice to the Auction Agent setting forth the
                Acceptable Discount. If the Auction Agent shall fail to receive an Acceptance and

                received by Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date,
                within three Business Days after receipt of an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice (the

                Discount in accordance with this ‎Section 2.05(a)(v)(D). If the Company Party elects
                to accept any Acceptable Discount, then the Company Party agrees to accept all
                Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by the Solicited

                will prepay outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this subsection (D) to each
                Qualifying Lender in the aggregate principal amount and of the tranches specified in
                such Lender’s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer at the Acceptable Discount;
                provided that if the aggregate Offered Amount by all Qualifying Lenders whose
                Offered Discount is greater than or equal to the Acceptable Discount exceeds the
                Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the
                Term Loans for those Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is greater than or

                Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) will calculate such proration
                (the “Solicited Discount Proration”). On or prior to the Discounted Prepayment
                Determination Date, the Auction Agent shall promptly notify (I) the relevant Company
                Party of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and Acceptable Prepayment Amount
                comprising the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment and the tranches to be prepaid, (II)
                each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Acceptable
                Discount, and the Acceptable Prepayment Amount of all Term Loans and the tranches to
                be prepaid to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (III) each
                Qualifying Lender of the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of such Term
                Lender to be prepaid at the Acceptable Discount on such date, and (IV) if
                applicable, each Identified Qualifying Lender of the Solicited Discount Proration.
                Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing
                notices to such Company Party and Term Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for
                all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to

                in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the

                the remaining principal installments of the relevant tranche of Loans on a pro rata
                basis across such installments. The Term Loans so prepaid shall be accompanied by
                all accrued and unpaid interest on the par principal amount so prepaid up to, but
                not including, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date. Each prepayment of the
                outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this ‎Section 2.05(a)(v) shall be paid to the

                against the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, in connection with any

                required pursuant to ‎Section 2.05(b)(i) or ‎(ii), each Lender of Term Loans will
                have the right to refuse such offer of prepayment by giving written notice of such
                refusal to the Administrative Agent within one (1) Business Day after such Lender’s
                receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of such offer of prepayment
                (“Declined Proceeds”) (in which case the Borrower shall not prepay any Term Loans of
                such Lender on the date that is specified in clause ‎(B) below), the Borrower will
                make all such prepayments not so refused upon the fourth Business Day after delivery
                of notice by the Borrower pursuant to ‎Section 2.05(b)(vi) and any Declined Proceeds
                may be retained by the Borrower.</p>
            <p>(ix) In connection with any mandatory prepayments by the Borrower of the Term Loans
                pursuant to this ‎Section 2.05(b), such prepayments shall be applied on a pro rata
                basis to the then outstanding Term Loans of the applicable Class or Classes being
                prepaid irrespective of whether such outstanding Term Loans are Base Rate Loans,
                Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans; provided that if no Lenders exercise the
                right to waive a given mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to ‎Section
                2.05(b)(viii), then, with respect to such mandatory prepayment, the amount of such
                mandatory prepayment within any tranche of Term Loans shall be applied first to Term
                Loans of such tranche that are Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before
                application to Term Loans of such tranche that are Eurocurrency Rate Loans in a
                manner that minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower
                pursuant to ‎Section 3.05.</p>
            <p>(c) Foreign Dispositions and Excess Cash Flow. Notwithstanding any other provisions
                of this ‎Section 2.05, (i) to the extent that any or all of the Net Proceeds of
                any</p>

            <p>Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (“Foreign Disposition”) or Excess Cash Flow
                attributable to Foreign Subsidiaries are prohibited or delayed by applicable local
                law from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds or
                Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans
                at the times provided in this ‎Section 2.05 but may be retained by the applicable
                Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not
                permit repatriation to the United States (the Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the
                applicable Foreign Subsidiary to promptly take all actions reasonably required by
                the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of
                any of such affected Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow that, in each case, would
                otherwise be required to be used to make an offer of prepayment pursuant to Sections
                ‎2.05(b)(i) or ‎2.05(b)(ii), is permitted under the applicable local law, such
                repatriation will be immediately effected and such repatriated Net Proceeds or
                Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any event not later than two Business Days
                after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved
                against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this
                ‎Section 2.05 and (ii) to the extent that the Borrower has reasonably determined in
                good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign
                Disposition or Foreign Subsidiary’s Excess Cash Flow would have material adverse Tax
                cost consequences to Holdings, the Borrower, any direct or indirect owner of the
                Borrower or any of the Borrower’s direct or indirect Subsidiaries with respect to
                such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so
                affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that in the
                case of this clause (ii), on or before the date on which any such Net Proceeds so
                retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to reinvestments or
                prepayments pursuant to ‎Section 2.05(b) or any such Excess Cash Flow would have
                been required to be applied to prepayments pursuant to ‎Section 2.05(b), the
                Borrower applies an amount equal to such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such
                reinvestments or prepayments, as applicable, as if such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash
                Flow had been received by the Borrower rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, less the
                amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such
                Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Proceeds
                or Excess Cash Flow that would be calculated if received by such Foreign
                Subsidiary).</p>

            <p>. Optional. The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent,

                reduce the unused Commitments of any Class, in each case without premium or penalty;
                provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent

                Class, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount
                of the applicable Revolving Credit Facility, such sublimit shall be automatically
                reduced by the amount of such excess. The amount of any such Commitment reduction

                shall be made on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days
                elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made,
                and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the
                Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day
                on which it is made shall, subject to ‎Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1)
                day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee
                hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
                error.</p>

            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
                accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries
                in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes
                of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrower, in each case
                in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the
                Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest
                error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and
                the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so
                shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower
                hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of
                any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the
                accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the
                accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
                manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative
                Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the
                Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender and its registered assignees,
                which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.
                Each Lender, may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
                applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect
                thereto.</p>
            <p>(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in ‎Section 2.11(a), each
                Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual
                practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entries
                in the Register, evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations
                in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the
                accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and
                records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the
                Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.</p>
            <p>(c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant
                to Sections ‎2.11(a) and ‎(b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts
                pursuant to Sections ‎2.11(a) and ‎(b), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount
                of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
                Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such
                account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
                absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such
                Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register
                or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of
                the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.</p>
            <p>Section 2.12. Payments Generally</p>
            <p>. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or
                deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise
                expressly provided herein and except with respect to an Approved Foreign Currency,
                all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent,
                for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the

            <p>Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments and in Same Day Funds
                not later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the date specified herein. Except as
                otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder in an
                Approved Foreign Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account
                of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable
                Administrative Agent’s Office in such Approved Foreign Currency and in Same Day
                Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. (London time) (or, if earlier, 9:00 a.m. New York
                city time) on the dates specified herein. If, for any reason, the Borrower is
                prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Approved
                Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in an amount equal
                to the Dollar Equivalent of such Approved Foreign Currency payment amount. The
                Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro
                Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like
                funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s applicable Lending Office. All
                payments received by the Administrative Agent after the time specified above shall
                in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any
                applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.</p>
            <p>(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower
                shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
                following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing
                interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that if such extension would cause
                payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Rate
                Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made
                on the immediately preceding Business Day.</p>
            <p>(c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to
                the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent
                hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such
                payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as
                the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required
                to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person
                entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the
                Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then:</p>
            <p>(i) with respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account
                of the Lenders hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which
                determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following
                applies (such payment referred to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) the Borrower has
                failed to make such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in
                excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the
                Administrative agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment;
                then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
                forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day
                Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the
                date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to
                the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the
                Overnight Bank Funding Rate,</p>
            <p>149</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by
                the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing; and</p>
            <p>(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment (including, without limitation,
                failure to fund participations in respect of any Letter of Credit or Swing Line
                Loan), such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the
                amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from
                the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower
                to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the “Compensation
                Period”) at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Bank Funding Rate, plus any
                reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the
                Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. When such Lender makes
                payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon),
                then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have
                accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such
                Lender’s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such
                amount (including, without limitation, failure to fund participations in respect of
                any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan) forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s
                demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the
                Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent,
                together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
                to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall
                be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to
                prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against
                any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.</p>
            <p>A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to
                any amount owing under this ‎Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest
                error.</p>
            <p>(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to
                be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article 2,
                and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent
                because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article 4 or
                in the applicable Incremental Amendment, Extension Amendment or Refinancing
                Amendment are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the
                Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such
                Lender) to such Lender, without interest.</p>
            <p>(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations
                in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of
                any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required
                hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do
                so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
                Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation.</p>
            <p>150</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any
                Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any
                Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular
                place or manner.</p>
            <p>(g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or
                any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and
                payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this
                Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be
                distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and
                the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in ‎Section 8.04. If the
                Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan
                Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the
                Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the
                Administrative Agent may (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of
                applicable Law), but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to
                each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the sum of
                (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (b) the
                Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or
                prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such
                Lender.</p>
            <p>Section 2.13. Sharing of Payments</p>
            <p>. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on
                account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations and Swing
                Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
                exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or
                other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately notify
                the Administrative Agent of such fact, and purchase from the other Lenders such
                participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the
                participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may
                be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
                payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro
                rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment
                is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances
                described in ‎Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by
                the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be
                rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase
                price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender’s ratable
                share (according to the proportion of the amount of such paying Lender’s required
                repayment to the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any
                interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the
                total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For avoidance of doubt,
                the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
                by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
                Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising
                from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or any payment obtained by a Lender as
                consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans
                to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder. The Borrower agrees that any
                Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest
                extent</p>

                of setoff, but subject to ‎Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as
                fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
                such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be
                conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased
                under this ‎Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such
                purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this
                ‎Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices,
                requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with
                respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the
                purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.</p>
            <p>Section 2.14. Incremental Credit Extensions</p>
            <p>. Incremental Commitments. The Borrower may, at any time or from time to time after
                the Closing Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent (an “Incremental Loan
                Request”), request (A) one or more new commitments which may be in the same Facility
                as any outstanding Term Loans of an existing Class (a “Term Loan Increase”) or a new
                Class of Term Loans (each, an “Incremental Term Facility”, collectively with any
                Term Loan Increase, the “Incremental Term Commitments”) and/or (B) one or more
                increases in the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class or any
                Incremental Revolving Facility (a “Revolving Commitment Increase”) or the
                establishment of one or more new revolving credit commitments (each, an “Incremental
                Revolving Facility” and collectively with any Incremental Term Facility, an
                “Incremental Facility” and any such new commitments, collectively with any Revolving

                Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, collectively with any Incremental Term
                Commitments, the “Incremental Commitments”), whereupon the Administrative Agent
                shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders. The Incremental Facilities
                shall be (A) secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Liens securing
                the Initial Term Loans, (B) secured by the Collateral on a junior Lien basis to the
                Liens securing the Initial Term Loans or (C) unsecured.</p>
            <p>(b) Incremental Loans. Any Incremental Commitments effected through the establishment
                of one or more new revolving credit commitments or new Term Loans not in the same
                Facility of any existing Class of Term Loans made on an Incremental Facility Closing
                Date shall be designated a separate Class of Incremental Commitments for all
                purposes of this Agreement. On any Incremental Facility Closing Date on which any
                Incremental Term Commitments of any Class are effected (including through any Term
                Loan Increase), subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions in this
                ‎Section 2.14, each Incremental Term Lender of such Class shall make a Loan to the
                Borrower (or any Loan Party organized under the laws of the United States, any state
                thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof, may be designated as a

                are the same as with respect to the Loans hereunder) (an “Incremental Term Loan”) in

                Credit Commitment of such Class and the Incremental Revolving Credit Loans of such
                Class made pursuant thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, Incremental Term Loans may
                have identical terms to any of the Term Loans and be treated as the same Class as
                any of such Term Loans.</p>

                Commitments, as applicable, to such Lender or Additional Lender, with respect to
                Incremental Term Commitments, any Affiliated Lender providing an Incremental Term
                Commitment shall be subject to the same restrictions set forth in ‎Section 10.07(l)

                Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, unless subsequently purchased from a

                least three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which Lenders under the Existing
                Term Loan Tranche or Existing Revolver Tranche, as applicable, are requested to
                respond, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be established by, or
                acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to
                accomplish the purposes of this ‎Section 2.16. No Lender shall have any obligation
                to agree to have any of its Term Loans of any Existing Term Loan Tranche amended
                into Extending Term Loans or any of its Revolving Credit Commitments amended into
                Extending Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, pursuant to any Extension
                Request. Any Lender holding a Loan under an Existing Term Loan Tranche (each, an
                “Extending Term Lender”) wishing to have all or a portion of its Term Loans under
                the Existing Term Loan Tranche subject to such Extension Request amended into
                Extending Term Loans and any Revolving Credit Lender (each, an “Extending Revolving
                Credit Lender”) wishing to have all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitments
                under the Existing Revolver Tranche subject to such Extension Request amended into
                Extending Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, shall notify the
                Administrative Agent (each, an “Extension Election”) on or prior to the date
                specified in such Extension Request of the amount of its Term Loans under the
                Existing Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing
                Revolver Tranche, as applicable, which it has elected to request be amended into
                Extending Term Loans or Extending Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable
                (subject to any minimum denomination requirements imposed by the Administrative
                Agent). In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans under the
                Existing Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing
                Revolver Tranche, as applicable, in respect of which applicable Term Lenders or
                Revolving Credit Lenders, as the case may be, shall have accepted the relevant
                Extension Request exceeds the amount of Extending Term Loans or Extending Revolving
                Credit Commitments, as applicable, requested to be extended pursuant to the
                Extension Request, Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable,
                subject to Extension Elections shall be amended to Extending Term Loans or Revolving
                Credit Commitments, as applicable, on a pro rata basis (subject to rounding by the
                Administrative Agent, which shall be conclusive) based on the aggregate principal
                amount of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, included in
                each such Extension Election.</p>
            <p>(d) Extension Amendment. Extending Term Loans and Extending Revolving Credit
                Commitments shall be established pursuant to an amendment (each, an “Extension
                Amendment”) to this Agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each
                Extending Term Lender or Extending Revolving Credit Lender, as applicable, providing
                an Extending Term Loan or Extending Revolving Credit Commitment, as applicable,
                thereunder, which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth in Sections
                ‎2.16(a) or ‎(b) above, respectively (but which shall not require the consent of any
                other Lender). The effectiveness of any Extension Amendment shall be subject to the
                satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in ‎Section
                4.02(i) and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt
                by the Administrative Agent of legal opinions, board resolutions and officers’
                certificates consistent with those delivered on the</p>

                change in fact or change to counsel’s form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the
                Administrative Agent and reaffirmation agreements and/or such amendments to the
                Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in
                order to ensure that the Extending Term Loans or Extending Revolving Credit
                Commitments, as applicable, are provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan
                Documents. The Borrower may, at its election, specify as a condition to consummating
                any Extension Amendment that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the
                relevant Extension Request in the Borrower’s sole discretion and as may be waived by
                the Borrower) of Term Loans, Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Revolving
                Credit Commitments (as applicable) of any or all applicable Classes be tendered. The
                Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of
                each Extension Amendment. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that this
                Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to an Extension
                Amendment, without the consent of any other Lenders, to the extent (but only to the
                extent) necessary to (i) reflect the existence and terms of the Extending Term Loans
                or Extending Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, incurred pursuant thereto,
                (ii) modify the scheduled repayments set forth in ‎Section 2.07 with respect to any
                Existing Term Loan Tranche subject to an Extension Election to reflect a reduction
                in the principal amount of the Term Loans thereunder in an amount equal to the
                aggregate principal amount of the Extending Term Loans amended pursuant to the
                applicable Extension (with such amount to be applied ratably to reduce scheduled
                repayments of such Term Loans required pursuant to ‎Section 2.07), (iii) modify the
                prepayments set forth in ‎Section 2.05 to reflect the existence of the Extending
                Term Loans and the application of prepayments with respect thereto, (iv) make such
                other changes to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents consistent with the
                provisions and intent of the second paragraph of ‎Section 10.01 (without the consent

                this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in
                the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the
                provisions of this ‎Section 2.16, and the Required Lenders hereby expressly
                authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such Extension Amendment.</p>
            <p>(e) No conversion of Loans pursuant to any Extension in accordance with this ‎Section
                2.16 shall constitute a voluntary or mandatory payment or prepayment for purposes of
                this Agreement.</p>

            <p>. Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
                if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is
                no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:</p>

                as set forth in ‎Section 10.01.</p>
            <p>(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
                amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting
                Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 8 or
                otherwise), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
                Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that
                Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a
                pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to L/C Issuers or
                Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or
                requested by any L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for
                future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any
                Swing Line Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as
                no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to the funding of
                any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion
                thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;
                fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in
                a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations
                of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment
                of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers or the Swing Line Lender as a
                result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender,
                any L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result
                of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh,
                so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the
                payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court
                of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as
                a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
                and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of
                competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the
                principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting
                Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C
                Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in ‎Section 4.02 were
                satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and
                L/C Borrowings owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to
                being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that
                Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a
                Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting
                Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this ‎Section 2.17(a)(ii) shall be
                deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably
                consents hereto.</p>
            <p>(iii) Certain Fees. That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to receive any
                commitment fee pursuant to ‎Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender
                is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee
                that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to</p>

                Credit fees as provided in ‎Section 2.03(h).</p>
            <p>(iv) Reallocation of Pro Rata Share to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in
                which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the
                obligation of each Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund
                participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections ‎2.03
                and ‎2.04, the Pro Rata Share of each Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Credit Loans
                and L/C Obligations shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of
                that Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be given
                effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no
                Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and (ii) the aggregate
                obligation of each Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund
                participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the
                positive difference, if any, of the Revolving Credit Commitment of that
                Non-Defaulting Lender minus the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans of that
                Lender. Subject to Section 10.23, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a
                waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender
                arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a
                Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure
                following such reallocation. If the allocation described in this clause (iv) cannot,
                or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any
                right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line
                Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders’ Fronting Exposure and (y)
                second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the
                procedures satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion).</p>
            <p>(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Swing Line
                Lender and the L/C Issuers agree in writing in their sole discretion that a
                Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the
                Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the
                effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth
                therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that
                Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of
                the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
                determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Loans and funded and
                unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a
                pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share (without
                giving effect to ‎Section 2.17(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a
                Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with
                respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that
                Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent
                otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from
                Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
                party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.</p>

                account of the Borrower (the term Borrower under this Article 3 being deemed to
                include any Subsidiary for whose account a Letter of Credit is issued) or any
                Guarantor under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
                deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,

                that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
                additional sums payable under this ‎Section 3.01), each of such Agent and such
                Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
                deductions been made, the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions,

                acceptable to such Agent or Lender.</p>

                the Loan Documents or the transactions therein, except for such Assignment Taxes

                being hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).</p>
            <p>(c) Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for the full

                Administrative Agent) shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by the
                Borrower or the Administrative Agent, provide the Borrower and the Administrative

                ineligibility to do so. Unless the applicable withholding agent has received forms

                by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and
                the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine
                whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under
                FATCA and to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.

                made to FATCA after the Closing Date.</p>

                and ‎Section 3.04(a) shall, if requested by the Borrower, use its reasonable efforts
                to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office (or take any other measures
                reasonably requested by the Borrower) if such a change or other measures would
                reduce any such additional amounts (including any such additional amounts that may
                thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, result
                in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to
                such Lender.</p>

                Other Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it
                by any Loan Party pursuant to this ‎Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such

                interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
                respect to such refund); provided that such Loan Party, upon the request of the
                Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agrees promptly to return such refund (plus any
                penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority)

            <p>Section 3.02. Illegality</p>
            <p>. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
                Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
                applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether
                denominated in Dollars or any other Approved Currency) or Term SOFR Loans, or to
                determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or Term SOFR,
                then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative
                Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
                Term SOFR Loans in the affected currency or currencies, or, in the case of
                Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars, to convert Base
                Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, shall be
                suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that
                the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of
                such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
                Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in
                Dollars, convert all applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as
                applicable, of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the
                Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
                Eurocurrency Rate Loans or such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or</p>

            <p>promptly, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate
                Loans or Term SOFR Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall
                also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted and all amounts due,
                if any, in connection with such prepayment or conversion under ‎Section 3.05. Each
                Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid
                the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender,
                otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. For the avoidance of doubt,
                invalidity of the Term SOFR determined pursuant to clause (a) thereof without giving
                effect to clause (a)(ii) thereof shall not affect ability of the Borrower to incur
                Daily SOFR Loans pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition thereof.</p>

            <p>. If either the Required Lenders determine or the Administrative Agent reasonably
                determines in good faith that (i) for any reason adequate and reasonable means do
                not exist for determining the applicable Eurocurrency Rate for any requested
                Interest Period or Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period, as applicable, with
                respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan in a given Approved
                Currency, or (ii) that the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with
                respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan in such Approved Currency does not
                adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or that
                deposits in the applicable Approved Currency in which such proposed Eurocurrency
                Rate Loan is to be denominated are not being offered to banks in the applicable
                offshore interbank market for the applicable amount and the Interest Period of such
                Eurocurrency Rate Loan, in each case, in the applicable Approved Currency, the
                Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
                Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate
                Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, in the affected Approved Currency shall be
                suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required
                Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke
                any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
                Eurocurrency Rate Loans or a Borrowing of or conversion to Term SOFR Loans, in each
                case, denominated in the affected Approved Currency, and make any such request into
                a request for a Borrowing of Daily SOFR Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to
                have converted such request, if applicable, into a request for a Borrowing of Base
                Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.</p>

                Eurocurrency Rate Loans</p>
            <p>. If any Lender reasonably determines that as a result of the introduction of or any
                change in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the Closing Date,
                or such Lender’s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to
                such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurocurrency
                Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or
                a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with
                any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this ‎Section 3.04(a) any such
                increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from Indemnified Taxes or Other
                Taxes, or any Taxes excluded from the</p>

                requirements contemplated by ‎Section 3.04(c)) and the result of any of the
                foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining the
                Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligations to make any Loan), or to
                reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, then from time
                to time within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender setting forth in
                reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the
                Administrative Agent given in accordance with ‎Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay
                to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
                increased cost or reduction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for
                all purposes under this Agreement, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
                Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder
                or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or
                directives promulgated by the Bank for International settlements, the Basel
                Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the
                United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III,
                shall in each case be deemed to be a change in Law, regardless of the date enacted,
                adopted or issued.</p>
            <p>(b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital
                adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after
                the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith,
                has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any
                Person controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations
                hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy
                and such Lender’s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of
                such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of
                such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent
                given in accordance with ‎Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
                additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction within fifteen
                (15) days after receipt of such demand.</p>
            <p>(c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required
                to maintain reserves, capital or liquidity with respect to liabilities or assets
                consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional interest on
                the unpaid principal amount of each applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan of the
                Borrower equal to the actual costs of such reserves, capital or liquidity allocated
                to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which
                determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error), and as long as
                such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio, capital or liquidity
                requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial
                regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the
                funding of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans of the Borrower, such additional costs
                (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the
                nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment
                or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which
                determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) which in each case shall be
                due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided the
                Borrower shall have received at least fifteen (15) days’ prior notice (with a copy
                to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such Lender.
                If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen</p>

                cost shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.</p>
            <p>(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to
                this ‎Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand
                such compensation.</p>
            <p>(e) If any Lender requests compensation under this ‎Section 3.04, then such Lender
                will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate
                another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event;
                provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of
                such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material
                economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in
                this ‎Section 3.04(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the
                Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Sections 3.04‎(a), ‎(b), ‎(c) or
                ‎(d).</p>
            <p>(f) Notwithstanding anything set forth in clauses (a)-(c) above, any Lender shall be
                compensated pursuant to this ‎Section 3.04 only if such Lender imposes such costs or
                charges under other syndicated credit facilities involving similarly situated
                borrowers that such Lender is a lender under.</p>
            <p>Section 3.05. Funding Losses</p>
            <p>. Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from
                time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such
                Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense actually incurred by it as a result
                of:</p>
            <p>(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan
                of the Borrower on a day prior to the last day of the Interest Period for such
                Loan;</p>
            <p>(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender
                to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurocurrency Rate Loan of
                the Borrower on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower, including any
                loss or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) arising from the liquidation
                or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable
                to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained; or</p>
            <p>(c) any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any
                Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Approved Foreign
                Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different
                currency.</p>
            <p>For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
                ‎Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate
                Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or
                other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for the applicable currency for a
                comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate

                the applicable Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period.</p>

            <p>. Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article 3 shall deliver a
                certificate to the Borrower setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be
                paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
                determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging
                and attribution methods.</p>
            <p>(b) With respect to any Lender’s claim for compensation under Sections ‎3.01, ‎3.02,
                ‎3.03 or ‎3.04, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any
                amount incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that
                such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim;
                provided that if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then
                such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
                retroactive effect thereof. If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower
                under ‎Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the
                Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue
                from one Interest Period to another applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loan, to make Term
                SOFR Loans or, if applicable, to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate
                Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, until the event or condition giving rise to
                such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of ‎Section
                3.06(c) shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the
                right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.</p>
            <p>(c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue any Eurocurrency Rate Loan,
                make Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
                Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, shall be suspended pursuant to ‎Section 3.06(b)
                hereof, such Lender’s applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loan, as
                applicable, shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans (or, if such
                conversion is not possible, repaid) on the last day(s) of the then current Interest
                Period(s) for such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of an
                immediate conversion required by ‎Section 3.02, on such earlier date as required by
                Law) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the
                circumstances specified in Sections ‎3.02, ‎3.03 or ‎3.04 hereof that gave rise to
                such conversion no longer exist:</p>
            <p>(i) to the extent that such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as
                applicable, have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that
                would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
                Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans;
                and</p>
            <p>(ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued from one Interest Period to
                another by such Lender as Eurocurrency Rate Loans or made as Term</p>
            <p>175</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>SOFR Loans, as applicable, shall be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans (if
                possible), and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted
                into Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, shall remain as Base
                Rate Loans.</p>
            <p>(d) If any Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
                Agent) that the circumstances specified in Sections ‎3.02, ‎3.03 or ‎3.04 hereof
                that gave rise to the conversion of any of such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
                Term SOFR Loans, as applicable, pursuant to this ‎Section 3.06 no longer exist
                (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist)
                at a time when Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans made by other Lenders
                under the applicable Facility are outstanding, if applicable, such Lender’s Base
                Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next
                succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term
                SOFR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans
                held by the Lenders holding Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans under such
                Facility and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest
                rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments
                for the applicable Facility.</p>
            <p>Section 3.07. Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances</p>
            <p>. If at any time the Borrower becomes obligated to pay additional amounts or
                indemnity payments described in ‎Section 3.01 (with respect to Indemnified Taxes) or
                ‎Section 3.04 as a result of any condition described in such Sections or any Lender
                ceases to make any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, in each case, as a
                result of any condition described in ‎Section 3.02 or ‎Section 3.04, any Lender
                becomes a Defaulting Lender or any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the
                Borrower, may so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at its
                sole cost and expense, on ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice to the
                Administrative Agent and such Lender, (x) replace such Lender by causing such Lender
                to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section 10.07(b) (with
                the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) all of its rights
                and obligations under this Agreement (in respect of any applicable Facility only in
                the case of clause ‎(i) or (ii) or, with respect to a Class vote, clause ‎(iii)) to
                one or more Eligible Assignees (or with respect to any assignment to any Affiliated
                Lender, pursuant to Section 10.07(l)); provided that neither the Administrative
                Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement
                Lender or other such Person; and provided, further, that in the case of any such
                assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under ‎Section 3.04 or payments
                required to be made pursuant to ‎Section 3.01 (with respect to Indemnified Taxes),
                such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and in
                the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting
                Lender, the applicable Eligible Assignees shall have agreed to, and shall be
                sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of,
                the applicable departure, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents; or (y)
                terminate the Commitment of such Lender or L/C Issuer (in respect of any applicable
                Facility only in the case of clauses ‎(i) - ‎(iii)), as the case may be, and in the
                case of a Lender (other than an L/C Issuer), repay all Obligations of the Borrower
                owing to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such</p>
            <p>176</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>Lender as of such termination date and in the case of an L/C Issuer, repay all
                Obligations of the Borrower owing to such L/C Issuer relating to the Loans and
                participations held by the L/C Issuer as well as all Letters of Credit issued by
                such L/C Issuer as of such termination date and cancel or backstop on terms
                satisfactory to such L/C Issuer any Letters of Credit issued by it; provided that in
                the case of any such termination of a Non-Consenting Lender such termination shall
                be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders) to cause the adoption of
                the applicable departure, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents and such
                termination shall be in respect of any applicable Facility only in the case of
                clause (i) or (ii) or, with respect to a Class vote, clause ‎(iii).</p>
            <p>(b) Any Lender being replaced pursuant to ‎Section 3.07(a)(x) above shall execute and
                deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender’s applicable
                Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and Swing
                Line Loans in respect thereof, and deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the
                Borrower or Administrative Agent. Pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, the
                assignee Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the case may be, of the assigning
                Lender’s Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and
                Swing Line Loans, all obligations of the Borrower owing to the assigning Lender
                relating to the Loans, Commitments and participations so assigned shall be paid in
                full by the assignee Lender to such assigning Lender concurrently with such
                Assignment and Assumption and upon such payment and, if so requested by the assignee
                Lender, delivery to the assignee Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
                the Borrower, the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the assigning
                Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to such assigned
                Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification
                provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender. In
                connection with any such replacement, if any such Non-Consenting Lender or
                Defaulting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly
                executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within five (5)
                Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such
                Assignment and Assumption to such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender, then
                such Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and
                delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the
                Non-Consenting Lender or Defaulting Lender.</p>
            <p>(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, any Lender that acts as
                an L/C Issuer may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has any Letter of
                Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L/C
                Issuer (including the furnishing of a backup standby letter of credit in form and
                substance, and issued by an issuer reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer or the
                depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant
                to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer) have been made with
                respect to each such outstanding Letter of Credit and the Lender that acts as the
                Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the
                terms of ‎Section 9.09.</p>
            <p>(d) In the event that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested that the
                Lenders consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or
                agree to any amendment thereto, the consent, waiver or amendment in question
                requires</p>

                a consent, waiver or amendment involving all affected Lenders of a certain Class,
                the Required Class Lenders as applicable) have agreed to such consent, waiver or
                amendment, then any Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment
                shall be deemed a “Non-Consenting Lender.”</p>
            <p>Section 3.08. Survival</p>

                statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make
                the statements therein (when taken as a whole), in the light of the circumstances
                under which they were made, not materially misleading. With respect to projected
                financial information and pro forma financial information, the Borrower represents
                that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
                be reasonable at the time of preparation; it being understood that such projections
                may vary from actual results and that such variances may be material.</p>
            <p>Section 5.14. Labor Matters</p>
            <p>. Except as, in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
                Adverse Effect as of the Closing Date there are no strikes or other labor disputes
                against the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pending or, to the
                knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, hours worked by and payment made to employees
                of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries have not been in violation of
                the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Laws, the Borrower and the
                other Loan Parties have complied with all applicable labor Laws including work
                authorization and immigration and all payments due from the Borrower or any of its
                Restricted Subsidiaries on account of employee wages and health and welfare and
                other benefits insurance have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of

                design rights and other intellectual property rights (collectively, “IP Rights”)
                that are reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as
                currently conducted, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, such IP Rights do not
                conflict with the rights of any Person, except to the extent such failure to own,
                license or possess or such conflicts, either individually or in the aggregate, would
                not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of
                the Borrower, the business of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
                conducted does not infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate any IP Rights
                held by any Person except for such infringements, misappropriations and violations,
                individually or in the aggregate, which would not reasonably be expected to have a
                Material Adverse Effect. No claim or litigation regarding any of the IP Rights, is
                filed and presently pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, presently
                threatened in writing against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, which,
                either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
                Material Adverse Effect.</p>

                aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.</p>

                Documents, to the extent required pursuant to the Collateral and Guarantee
                Requirement. If the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent reasonably
                determines that it is required by applicable Law to have appraisals prepared in
                respect of the Real Property of any Loan Party subject to a Mortgage constituting
                Collateral, the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent appraisals that

                Subsidiary; provided that immediately before and after such designation, no Event of
                Default shall have occurred and be continuing and no Subsidiary may be designated as
                an Unrestricted Subsidiary if it is a “Restricted Subsidiary” for the purpose of any
                Senior Notes Documents or any Junior Financing with an aggregate outstanding
                principal amount in excess of the Threshold Amount. The designation of any
                Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date shall constitute an
                Investment by the Borrower therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to
                the fair market value of the Borrower’s or its Subsidiary’s (as applicable)
                Investment therein. The designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
                Subsidiary shall constitute (i) the incurrence at the time of designation of any
                Investment, Indebtedness or Liens of such Subsidiary existing at such time and (ii)
                a return on any Investment by the Borrower in Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to
                the preceding sentence in an amount equal to the fair market value at the date of
                such designation of the Borrower’s or its Subsidiary’s (as applicable) Investment in
                such Subsidiary.</p>
            <p>Section 6.15. Maintenance of Ratings</p>
            <p>. In respect of the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Term
                Loans to be continuously rated (but not any specific rating) by S&amp;P and Moody’s
                and maintain a public corporate rating (but not any specific rating) from S&amp;P
                and a public corporate family rating (but not any specific rating) from Moody’s.</p>
            <p>Section 6.16. Post-Closing Covenants</p>
            <p>. Except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, the
                Borrower shall, and shall cause each of the other Loan Parties to, deliver each of
                the documents, instruments and agreements and take each of the actions set forth on

                as determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion).</p>

            <p>. The Borrower shall not, nor shall the Borrower permit any of the Restricted
                Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, engage in any material line of business
                substantially different from those lines of business conducted by the Borrower and
                the Restricted Subsidiaries on the Closing Date or any business reasonably related,
                complementary, synergistic or ancillary thereto or reasonable extensions
                thereof.</p>
            <p>Section 6.18. Use of Proceeds</p>
            <p>. The proceeds of the Initial Term Loans received on the Closing Date, together with
                the proceeds of the Senior Notes, shall not be used for any purpose other than for
                the Transactions and to fund cash to the Borrower’s balance sheet. The proceeds of
                the Initial Revolving Borrowing will be used to finance the Transactions and fees
                and expenses related to the Transactions and for working capital needs of the
                Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The proceeds of the First Incremental Term Loans

                Loans and the Incremental Term B-1 Loans received on the Amendment No. 7 Effective

            <p>After the Closing Date, the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line
                Loans shall be used for working capital, general corporate purposes and any other
                purpose not prohibited by this Agreement, including Permitted Acquisitions and other
                Investments. The Letters of Credit shall be used to support obligations of the

                which case, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent will, and are hereby
                authorized by the Lenders to, make any adjustments to this Agreement that are
                necessary to reflect such change in fiscal year.</p>

                this Agreement, the amount of any Designated Equity Contribution shall be no more
                than the amount required to cause the Borrower to be in Pro Forma Compliance with

                Indebtedness with the proceeds of any Designated Equity Contribution for determining
                compliance with ‎Section 7.11 for the fiscal quarter with respect to which such
                Designated Equity Contribution was made; provided that to the extent such proceeds
                are actually applied to prepay Indebtedness, such reduction may be credited in any
                subsequent fiscal quarter.</p>

            <p>Section 9.01. Appointment and Authorization of Agents</p>
            <p>. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the
                Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
                Documents, designates and authorizes each of the Administrative Agent and the
                Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
                Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such
                duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other
                Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
                Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders hereby expressly
                authorize the Administrative Agent to execute any and all documents (including
                releases) with respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with
                respect thereto, as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this
                Agreement and the Collateral Documents and acknowledge and agree that any such
                action by any Agent shall bind the Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision to the
                contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, neither the
                Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or
                responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
                relationship with any Lender or Participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
                responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
                Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative
                Agent or the Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
                sentence, the use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with
                reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or
                express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead,
                such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
                reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting
                parties.</p>
            <p>(b) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of
                Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each such L/C Issuer
                shall have all of the benefits and immunities provided to the Agents in this Article
                9 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in
                connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and
                the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of
                Credit as fully as if the term</p>

                included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and as additionally
                provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.</p>
            <p>(c) Each of the Secured Parties (by acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral
                Documents) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as
                the agent of (and to hold any security interest created by the Collateral Documents
                for and on behalf of or on trust for) such Secured Party for purposes of acquiring,
                holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by the Loan Parties to
                secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are
                reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Collateral Agent (and any
                co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent
                pursuant to ‎Section 9.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the
                Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for
                exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Collateral
                Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 9
                (including ‎Section 9.07, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact
                were the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein
                with respect thereto.</p>
            <p>(d) Each Lender and each other Secured Party (by acceptance of the benefits of the
                Collateral Documents) hereby acknowledges that it has received a copy of the
                Intercreditor Agreements, agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions
                contrary to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements to the extent then in
                effect, and authorizes and instructs the Collateral Agent to enter into each
                Intercreditor Agreement as Collateral Agent and on behalf of such Lender or Secured
                Party.</p>
            <p>(e) Except as provided in Sections ‎9.09 and ‎9.11, the provisions of this Article 9
                are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C
                Issuer, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a
                third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.</p>
            <p>Section 9.02. Delegation of Duties</p>
            <p>. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may execute any of its
                duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including for purposes of
                holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted
                under the Collateral Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies thereunder)
                by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice
                of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
                such duties. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent
                may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
                through their respective Agent-Related Persons. The exculpatory provisions of this
                Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Agent-Related Persons of the
                Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply
                to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities
                as well as activities as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. The
                Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of
                any agent or sub-agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross

            <p>. No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
                taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
                Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross

                Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or

                Collateral, any failure to monitor or maintain any part of the Collateral, or the
                perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest created or purported to be
                created under the Collateral Documents, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any
                other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
                No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or Participant
                to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
                agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
                Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any
                Affiliate thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent
                nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or
                exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly

                Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as applicable) shall not be required to
                take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the
                Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as applicable) to liability or that is
                contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of
                doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor
                Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property
                of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law.</p>

                certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,

                to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
                or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
                any Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent.
                Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
                any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
                Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be
                indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
                expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any
                such action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
                refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
                accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such greater number
                of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) and such request and
                any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
                Lenders.</p>
            <p>Section 9.05. Notice of Default</p>
            <p>. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
                occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
                principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the

                notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such
                Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Administrative
                Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative
                Agent shall take such action with respect to any Event of Default as may be directed
                by the Required Lenders (or, if a Financial Covenant Event of Default occurs and is

                consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan
                Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or

                Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also
                represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
                Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
                the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
                taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and

                documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein,

                property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan
                Parties or any of their Affiliates which may come into the possession of any
                Agent-Related Person.</p>
            <p>Section 9.07. Indemnification of Agents</p>
            <p>. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders
                shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed
                by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan
                Party to do so) acting as an Agent, pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related
                Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided
                that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any
                portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Agent-Related Person’s
                own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final
                non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that no
                action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such
                other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan
                Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for
                purposes of this ‎Section 9.07; provided, further, that any obligation to indemnify
                an L/C Issuer pursuant to this ‎Section 9.07 shall be limited to Revolving Credit
                Lenders only. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise
                to any Indemnified Liabilities, this ‎Section 9.07 applies whether any such
                investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other
                Person. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse each of the
                Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent upon demand for its ratable share of
                any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, in connection with
                the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
                enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or
                legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any
                other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the

                not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Loan Parties and without
                limiting their obligation to do so. The undertaking in this ‎Section 9.07 shall
                survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other
                Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,

                powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
                Swing Line Lender or an L/C Issuer, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include
                Bank of America in its individual capacity. Any successor to Bank of America as the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall also have the rights attributed
                to Bank of America under this ‎Section 9.08.</p>
            <p>Section 9.09. Successor Agents</p>
            <p>. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may resign as the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable upon thirty (30) days’
                notice to the Lenders and the Borrower and if either the Administrative Agent or the
                Collateral Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may remove such Defaulting
                Lender from such role upon ten (10) days’ notice to the Lenders. If the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent resigns under this Agreement or is
                removed by the Borrower, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
                successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be consented to by the
                Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under
                Sections ‎8.01(f) or ‎(g) (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably
                withheld or delayed). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date
                of the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,
                as applicable, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, in
                the case of a resignation, and the Borrower, in the case of a removal may appoint,
                after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower (in the case of a resignation), a
                successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
                successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall succeed
                to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or
                retiring Collateral Agent and the term “Administrative Agent” or “Collateral Agent”
                shall mean such successor administrative agent or collateral agent and/or
                Supplemental Agent, as the case may be, and the retiring Administrative Agent’s or
                Collateral Agent’s appointment, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent or
                Collateral Agent shall be terminated. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s or
                the Collateral Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent
                or Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Article 9 and the provisions of Sections
                ‎10.04 and ‎10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
                be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under</p>

            <p>this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as the Administrative
                Agent or the Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following the
                retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s notice of resignation or ten
                (10) days following the Borrower’s notice of removal, the retiring Administrative
                Agent’s or the retiring Collateral Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon
                become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the
                Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the
                Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Upon the
                acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent
                hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such
                financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices,
                as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order
                to (a) continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by
                the Collateral Documents or (b) otherwise ensure that ‎Section 6.11 is satisfied,
                the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
                vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the
                retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, and the retiring Administrative
                Agent or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
                the Loan Documents. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s
                resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, the
                provisions of this Article 9 and Sections ‎10.04 and ‎10.05 shall continue in effect
                for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
                it was acting as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.</p>
            <p>Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section
                shall also constitute its resignation as a L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender pursuant
                to Sections 2.03(q) and 2.04(h).</p>

                reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding
                relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the
                principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein
                expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
                Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower or the Collateral

                assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such
                judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent and, in the event that the
                Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
                Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent any amount due
                for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents

            <p>Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to

                the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect
                of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.</p>
            <p>The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the
                direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the
                Obligations (including accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of
                some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or
                otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more
                acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof
                conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States,
                including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United
                States, or any similar Laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is
                subject, (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of
                debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative
                Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable
                Law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to
                the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable
                basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving

                asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests or debt instruments of the
                acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In
                connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to
                form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents
                providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that
                any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or
                vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Equity Interests thereof shall
                be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders,

                vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be</p>

            <p>. Each Lender (including in its capacity as a counterparty to a Secured Hedge
                Agreement or Treasury Services Agreement) and each other Secured Party by its
                acceptance of the Collateral Documents irrevocably agrees:</p>

                collateralization of all Letters of Credit (or if such Letters of Credit have been
                backstopped by letters of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C
                Issuers or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
                applicable L/C Issuers), at the time the property subject to such Lien is Disposed

                required to grant a Lien to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under
                the Loan Documents, subject to ‎Section 10.01, if the release of such Lien is
                approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, to the extent
                such asset constitutes an Excluded Asset or if the property subject to such Lien is

                permitted hereunder; provided that no such release shall occur if such Guarantor

                Subsidiary; provided that 100% of the Equity Interests of the Borrower shall be
                pledged to the Administrative Agent to secure the Obligations; and</p>
            <p>(e) the Collateral Agent may, without any further consent of any Lender, enter into a
                First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with the collateral agent or other
                representatives of holders of Permitted Ratio Debt that is intended to be secured on
                a pari passu basis with the Liens securing the Obligations and/or a Junior Lien
                Intercreditor Agreement with the collateral agent or other representatives of the
                holders of Indebtedness permitted under ‎Section 7.03 that is intended to be secured
                on a junior Lien basis to the Liens securing the Obligations, in each case, where
                such Indebtedness is secured by Liens permitted under ‎Section 7.01. The Collateral
                Agent may rely exclusively on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower
                as to whether any such other Liens are permitted. Any First Lien Intercreditor
                Agreement or Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement entered into by the Collateral
                Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be binding on the Secured
                Parties.</p>
            <p>Upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent at any time, the
                Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s or the
                Collateral Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular
                types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under
                the Guaranty pursuant to this ‎Section 9.11. In each case as specified in this
                ‎Section 9.11, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent will promptly upon
                the request of the Borrower (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the
                Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to), at the Borrower’s expense,
                execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as the Borrower may
                reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of
                Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral
                Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under
                the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and
                this ‎Section 9.11 (and the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may rely
                conclusively on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower to that
                effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further
                inquiry). Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be
                without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.
                For the avoidance of doubt, no release of Collateral or Guarantors effected in the
                manner permitted by this ‎Section 9.11 shall require the consent of any holder of
                obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements or any Treasury Services Agreements.</p>
            <p>Section 9.12. Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers</p>
            <p>. None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature
                pages of this Agreement as a “joint bookrunner”, “joint lead arranger” or
                “co-manager” shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or
                duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.

            <p>foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so identified shall have or be deemed
                to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it
                has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders or other Persons so
                identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking

            <p>Section 9.13. Withholding Tax Indemnity</p>
            <p>. To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold
                from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding
                Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other authority of the United States or
                other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly
                withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason
                (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or
                not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative
                Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of
                withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall, within 10 days after written demand
                therefor, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent (to the extent that
                the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to
                ‎Section 3.01 and ‎Section 3.04 and without limiting or expanding the obligation of
                the Borrower to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
                Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred,
                including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such
                Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
                Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
                any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
                Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and

                Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this ‎Section 9.13.
                The agreements in this ‎Section 9.13 shall survive the resignation and/or
                replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the
                replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other
                Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Lender” for purposes of this

            <p>Section 9.14. Appointment of Supplemental Agents</p>
            <p>. It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall
                be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of
                banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in
                such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement
                or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of
                any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
                Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may
                not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the
                other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in
                connection therewith, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby
                authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the
                Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its sole discretion as a separate
                trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent,</p>

            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual
                or institution being referred to herein individually as a “Supplemental Agent” and
                collectively as “Supplemental Agents”).</p>
            <p>(b) In the event that the Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental Agent with respect
                to any Collateral, each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or
                intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or
                vested in or conveyed to the Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall
                be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Agent to the extent, and only to the
                extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Agent to exercise such rights, powers
                and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with
                respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan
                Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental
                Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Collateral Agent or such
                Supplemental Agent, and the provisions of this Article 9 and of Sections ‎10.04 and
                ‎10.05 that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such
                Supplemental Agent and all references therein to the Collateral Agent shall be
                deemed to be references to the Collateral Agent and/or such Supplemental Agent, as
                the context may require.</p>
            <p>(c) Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required by any
                Supplemental Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
                for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights,
                powers, privileges and duties, such Loan Party shall execute, acknowledge and
                deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative
                Agent or the Collateral Agent. In case any Supplemental Agent, or a successor
                thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the
                rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Agent, to the extent
                permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until
                the appointment of a new Supplemental Agent.</p>
            <p>Section 9.15. Erroneous Payments</p>
            <p>. Without limitation of any other provision in this Agreement, if at any time the
                Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Lender Party, whether
                or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by the Borrower at such time, where
                such payment is a Rescindable Amount, then in any such event, each Lender Party
                receiving a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
                forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount received by such Lender Party in
                immediately available funds in the currency so received, with interest thereon, for
                each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to
                but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
                Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
                accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Lender Party
                irrevocably waives any and all defenses, including any “discharge for value” (under
                which a creditor might otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a
                third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or similar defense to its
                obligation to return any Rescindable Amount. The Administrative Agent shall inform
                each Lender Party promptly upon determining that any payment made</p>

                Section 9.15 shall solely be an agreement between the Administrative Agent and the
                Lender Parties.</p>
            <p>Article 10<lb/>Miscellaneous</p>
            <p>Section 10.01. Amendments, Etc.</p>
            <p>. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or waiver of any
                provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any
                departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed
                by the Required Lenders, or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the
                Required Lenders, and such Loan Party (with an executed copy thereof promptly
                delivered to the Administrative Agent if not otherwise a party thereto) and each
                such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
                specific purpose for which given; provided that any amendment or waiver contemplated
                in clauses (g) or ‎(j) below, shall only require the consent of such Loan Party and
                the Required Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Facility Lenders under the
                applicable Facility, as applicable; provided, further, that no such amendment,

                condition precedent or of any Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction
                of the Commitments shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment
                of any Lender);</p>
            <p>(b) postpone any date scheduled for, or reduce or forgive the amount of, any payment

                waiver of (or amendment to the terms of) any mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans
                shall not constitute a postponement of any date scheduled for the payment of
                principal or interest and it being understood that any change to the definition of

                Document (or change the timing of payments of such fees or other amounts) without
                the written consent of each Lender holding such Loan, L/C Borrowing or to whom such
                fee or other amount is owed (it being understood that any change to the definition

                varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each
                Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and

                misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of

                Agent acting reasonably, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to
                any Lender or L/C Issuer pursuant to Article 2 if such Lender or L/C Issuer, as
                applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving
                notices under such Article by such communication. The Administrative Agent, the

                agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by FpML messaging
                and Internet or intranet websites pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided
                that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or

                privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
                thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
                privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
                of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
                privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are
                cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided

                fees related thereto, and other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses

                termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations. All
                amounts due under this ‎Section 10.04 shall be paid within thirty (30) days of
                receipt by the Borrower of an invoice relating thereto setting forth such expenses

                and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
                Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument
                may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
                to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the second proviso to
                ‎Section 10.01 that requires the affirmative vote of such Lender, in each case to
                the extent the Participant is directly and adversely affected thereby. Subject to
                ‎Section 10.07(g), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to
                the benefits of Sections ‎3.01, ‎3.04 and ‎3.05 (subject to the requirements and
                limitations of such Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
                acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to ‎Section 10.07(c). To the extent
                permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits
                of ‎Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees
                to be subject to ‎Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Participant and each
                SPC will provide any applicable tax forms required pursuant to Section 3.01(d)
                solely to the participating Lender or Granting Lender. Each Lender that sells a
                participation or grants a Loan to an SPC shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
                non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name
                and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and related interest
                amounts) of each Participant’s and each SPC’s interest in the Loans or other
                obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no
                Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant
                Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information
                relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit
                or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that (w) such
                disclosure is necessary in connection with an audit or other proceeding to establish

                trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person or (y)

                participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent,
                not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower
                shall have reasonable basis for withholding consent if any participation would

            <p>(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a
                “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such
                in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and

                any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to
                make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make
                such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) such SPC and the applicable Loan or
                any applicable part thereof, shall be appropriately reflected in the Participant
                Register. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the
                benefit of Sections ‎3.01, ‎3.04 and ‎3.05 (subject to the requirements and the
                limitations of such Section), but neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by
                any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or
                change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement except in the case of
                Sections ‎3.01 or ‎3.04, to the extent that the grant to the SPC was made with the
                prior written consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
                for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower shall have reasonable basis for withholding
                consent if an exercise by SPC immediately after the grant would result in materially
                increased indemnification obligations to the Borrower at such time), (ii) no SPC
                shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement
                for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all
                purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of

                of this ‎Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from
                any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such pledgee shall not be
                entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even
                though such pledgee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged
                interest through foreclosure or otherwise.</p>
            <p>(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any L/C Issuer or
                Swing Line Lender may, upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrower and the
                Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, respectively; provided that
                on or prior to the expiration of such 30-day period with respect to such
                resignation, the relevant L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender shall have identified a
                successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender reasonably acceptable to the Borrower
                willing to accept its appointment as successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as
                applicable, unless, at the option of the Borrower, the Borrower shall have appointed
                one or more L/C Issuers or Swing Line Lenders from among the Lenders willing to
                accept such appointment as a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;
                provided that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect
                the resignation of the relevant L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may
                be, except as expressly provided above. If an L/C Issuer resigns as an L/C Issuer,
                it shall retain all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer hereunder with
                respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
                resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including
                the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations
                in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to ‎Section 2.03(c)). If the Swing Line Lender
                resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line
                Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and
                outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to
                require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or fund risk

                the Administrative Agent or any Lender and will not be permitted to attend or
                participate in conference calls or meetings attended solely by the Lenders and the
                Administrative Agent, other than the right to receive notices of prepayments and

                outstanding (measured at the time of purchase) (such percentage, the “Affiliated
                Lender Cap”); provided that to the extent any assignment to an Affiliated Lender
                would result in the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans held by Affiliated

                willing to repurchase any Loans/Commitments of the Defaulting Lenders from the

                confidentiality of the Information and not to disclose such information, except that
                Information may be disclosed to its Affiliates and its Affiliates’ managers,

                investment advisors and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other

                such Information confidential); to the extent requested by any Governmental
                Authority or self-regulatory authority having or asserting jurisdiction over such
                Person (including any Governmental Authority or examiner (including the National
                Association of Insurance Commissioners or any other similar organization) regulating
                any Lender or its Affiliates); provided that the Administrative Agent, such Lead
                Arranger or such Lender, as applicable, agrees that it will notify the Borrower as
                soon as practicable in the event of any such disclosure by such Person (other than
                at the request of a regulatory authority or examiner) unless such notification is
                prohibited by law, rule or regulation; to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar
                agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect
                to the Facilities or market data collectors, similar services providers to the

                the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar
                legal process; provided that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable,

                any such Information to any Lenders or Eligible Assignees or Participants shall be
                made subject to the acknowledgement and acceptance by such Lender, Eligible Assignee
                or Participant that such Information is being disseminated on a confidential basis

                reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, including, without limitation, as agreed in
                any Borrower Materials) in accordance with the standard processes of the
                Administrative Agent or customary market standards for dissemination of such type of
                Information); with the written consent of the Borrower; to the extent such
                Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this
                ‎Section 10.08 or becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers,
                any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a</p>

            <p>non-confidential basis from a source other than a Loan Party or any Investor or their
                respective Affiliates (so long as such source is not known to the Administrative
                Agent, the Lead Arrangers, such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any of their respective
                Affiliates to be bound by confidentiality obligations to any Loan Party);
                [Reserved]; to any Rating Agency when required by it (it being understood that,
                prior to any such disclosure, such Rating Agency shall undertake to preserve the
                confidentiality of any Information relating to Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries
                received by it from such Lender) or to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar
                organization; in connection with establishing a “due diligence” defense or to the
                extent such Information is independently developed by the Administrative Agent, the
                Lead Arrangers, such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates;
                provided that no disclosure shall be made to any Disqualified Lender. In addition,
                the Agents and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and publicly
                available information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar
                service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agents and
                the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement,
                the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the
                purposes of this ‎Section 10.08, “Information” means all information received from
                the Loan Parties relating to any Loan Party, its Affiliates or its Affiliates’
                directors, managers, officers, employees, trustees, investment advisors or agents,
                relating to Holdings, the Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries or its business,
                other than any such information that is publicly available to any Agent, any L/C
                Issuer or any Lender prior to disclosure by any Loan Party other than as a result of
                a breach of this ‎Section 10.08; provided that all information received after the
                Closing Date from Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
                confidential unless such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery
                as not being confidential.</p>
            <p>Section 10.09. Setoff</p>
            <p>. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the
                occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender and its
                Affiliates (and the Collateral Agent, in respect of any unpaid fees, costs and
                expenses payable hereunder) is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
                prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its
                own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries) to the
                fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all
                deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held
                by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender and its Affiliates or
                the Collateral Agent to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan
                Parties and their Subsidiaries against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender
                and its Affiliates or the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Loan
                Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Agent or
                such Lender or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other
                Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or
                denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or
                Indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise
                any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately
                to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the
                provisions of ‎Section 2.17 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such
                Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the</p>
            <p>270</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, and the Lenders, and (y) the
                Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement
                describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as
                to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify
                the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application
                made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
                the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent,
                the Collateral Agent and each Lender under this ‎Section 10.09 are in addition to
                other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Administrative
                Agent, the Collateral Agent and such Lender may have. No amounts set off from any
                Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor.</p>
            <p>Section 10.10. Interest Rate Limitation</p>
            <p>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the
                interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the
                maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum
                Rate”). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds
                the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans
                or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining
                whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender
                exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable
                Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
                premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
                thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts
                the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations
                hereunder.</p>
            <p>Section 10.11. Counterparts</p>
            <p>. This Agreement and each other Loan Document may be executed in one or more
                counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together
                shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other
                electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
                Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original
                executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other Loan Document. The Agents may
                also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other
                electronic transmission be confirmed by an original thereof; provided that the
                failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any
                document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission.</p>
            <p>Section 10.12. Integration; Termination</p>
            <p>. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and
                integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and
                supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the
                event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any
                other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that
                the inclusion of</p>
            <p>271</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other
                Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document
                was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
                be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
                with the fair meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>Section 10.13. Survival of Representations and Warranties</p>
            <p>. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
                other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
                therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
                representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and
                each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or any Lender or on
                their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
                knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in
                full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
                remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.</p>
            <p>Section 10.14. Severability</p>
            <p>. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be
                illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the
                remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be
                affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
                jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
                other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this ‎Section
                10.14, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this
                Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as
                determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing
                Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect
                only to the extent not so limited.</p>
            <p>Section 10.15. GOVERNING LAW</p>
            <p>. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
                ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; provided, however, that (a) the
                interpretation of the definition of “Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the

                contemplated by the PURCHASE AGREEMENT shall, in each case, be governed and

                FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY
                ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER

                IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES (OTHER THAN TELECOPIER OR OTHER ELECTRONIC
                TRANSMISSION) IN ‎SECTION 10.02. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
                DOCUMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER
                MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER LOAN

                Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that
                the facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in
                connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other
                modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arm’s-length commercial
                transaction between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
                Agents, the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, and the Borrower is
                capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks
                and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan
                Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof),
                in connection with the process leading to such transaction, each of the Agents, the
                Lead Arrangers and the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and is
                not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary, for the Borrower or any of its
                Affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other Person, none of the
                Agents, the Lead Arrangers or the Lenders has assumed or will assume an advisory,

                the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto, including with
                respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan
                Document (irrespective of whether any Agent or Lender has advised or is currently
                advising the Borrower or any of its Affiliates on other matters) and none of the
                Agents, the Lead Arrangers or the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrower or any
                of its Affiliates with respect to the financing transactions contemplated hereby

                the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in
                a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from, and may
                conflict with, those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and none of the Agents, the
                Lead Arrangers or the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests
                by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship and the Agents, the Lead
                Arrangers and the Lenders have not provided and will not provide any legal,
                accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions
                contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or
                of any other Loan Document) and the Loan Parties have consulted their own legal,
                accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they have deemed appropriate.
                Each Loan Party hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
                any claims that it may have against the Agents, the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders
                with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty under
                applicable law relating to agency and fiduciary obligations.</p>
            <p>(b) Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that each Lender, the Lead Arrangers and
                any Affiliate thereof may lend money to, invest in, and generally engage in any kind
                of business with, any of the Borrower, Holdings, any Investor, any Affiliate thereof
                or any other person or entity that may do business with or own securities of any of
                the foregoing, all as if such Lender, the Lead Arrangers or Affiliate thereof were
                not a Lender, the Lead Arrangers or an Affiliate thereof (or an agent or any other
                person with any similar role under the Facilities) and without any duty to account
                therefor to any other Lender, the Lead Arrangers, Holdings, the Borrower, any
                Investor or any Affiliate of the foregoing. Each Lender, the Lead Arrangers and any
                Affiliate thereof may accept fees and other consideration from Holdings, the
                Borrower, any Investor or any Affiliate thereof for services in connection with this
                Agreement, the Facilities or otherwise without having to account for the same to any
                other Lender, the Lead Arrangers, Holdings, the Borrower, any Investor or any
                Affiliate of the foregoing. Some or all of the Lenders and the Lead Arrangers may
                have directly or indirectly acquired certain equity interests (including warrants)
                in Holdings, the Borrower, an Investor or an Affiliate thereof or may have directly
                or indirectly extended credit on a subordinated basis to Holdings, the Borrower, an
                Investor or an Affiliate thereof. Each party hereto, on its behalf and on behalf of
                its Affiliates, acknowledges and waives the potential conflict of interest resulting
                from any such Lender, the Lead Arrangers or an Affiliate thereof holding
                disproportionate interests in the extensions of credit under the Facilities or
                otherwise acting as arranger or agent thereunder and such Lender, the Lead Arrangers
                or any Affiliate thereof directly or indirectly holding equity interests in or
                subordinated debt issued by Holdings, the Borrower, an Investor or an Affiliate
                thereof.</p>

            <p>. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any
                Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the
                keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal
                effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a
                paper-based record keeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided
                for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and

            <p>Section 10.21. Effect of Certain Inaccuracies</p>
            <p>. In the event that any financial statement or Compliance Certificate previously
                delivered pursuant to ‎Section 6.02(a) was inaccurate or was restated (regardless of
                whether this Agreement or the Commitments are in effect when such inaccuracy is
                discovered), and such inaccuracy, if corrected, or such restatement would have led
                to the application of a higher Applicable Rate for any period (an “Applicable
                Period”) than the Applicable Rate applied for such Applicable Period, then (i) the
                Borrower shall as soon as practicable deliver to the Administrative Agent a
                corrected or restated financial statement and a corrected or updated Compliance
                Certificate for such Applicable Period, (ii) the Applicable Rate shall be determined
                based on the updated Compliance Certificate for such Applicable Period, and (iii)
                the Borrower shall within 15 days after the delivery of the corrected or restated
                financial statements and the updated Compliance Certificate pay to the
                Administrative Agent the accrued additional interest or fees owing as a result of
                such increased Applicable Rate for such Applicable Period. This ‎Section 10.21 shall
                not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect to
                Sections ‎2.08(b) and ‎8.01; provided that any underpayment due to change in
                Applicable Rate shall not in itself constitute a Default or Event of Default under
                Section 8.01 so long as such additional interest or fees are paid within the 15-day
                period set forth above.</p>
            <p>Section 10.22. Judgment Currency</p>
            <p>. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a
                sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein
                (the “specified currency”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the
                fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall
                be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures any Lender could
                purchase the specified currency with such other currency at such Lender’s New York
                office on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The
                obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender hereunder shall,
                notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be
                discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such
                Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender may in
                accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such
                other currency; if the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than
                the sum originally due to such Lender in the specified currency, the Borrower
                agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate
                obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Lender against
                such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum
                originally due to such Lender in the specified currency, such Lender agrees to remit
                such excess to the Borrower.</p>

                Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is
                unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable
                Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be
                bound by:</p>
            <p>(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable
                Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable
                to it by any party hereto to any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution;
                and</p>
            <p>(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if
                applicable:</p>

            <p>(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
                instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent
                undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred
                on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it
                in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any
                other Loan Document; or</p>
            <p>(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of
                the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.</p>
            <p>Section 10.24. Cashless Rollovers</p>
            <p>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any
                other Loan Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or
                replaces, renews or refinances, any of its then-existing Loans with Incremental
                Facilities, Facilities in connection with any Refinancing Series, Extending Term
                Loans, Extending Revolving Credit Loans or loans incurred under a new credit
                facility, in each case, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or
                refinancing is effected by means of a “cashless roll” by such Lender, such
                extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any
                requirement hereunder or any other Loan Document that such payment be made “in
                Dollars”, “in immediately available funds”, “in Cash” or any other similar
                requirement.</p>
            <p>Section 10.25. Acknowledgement Regarding any Supported QFCs</p>
            <p>. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or
                otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC
                (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the
                parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the
                Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and

                States or any other state of the United States):</p>

                transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any

                governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the
                event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a

                Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support
                that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no
                greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special
                Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the
                laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
                foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with
                respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered
                Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.</p>

                therein shall be amended or waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of
                the Guaranteed Obligations or except as permitted pursuant to ‎Section 11.10 any
                security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise

            <p>(v) the release of any other Guarantor pursuant to ‎Section 11.10.</p>
            <p>The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
                protest and, to the extent permitted by Law, all notices whatsoever, and any
                requirement that any Secured Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed
                against the Borrower under this Agreement, the Secured Hedge Agreements, the
                Treasury Services Agreements or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or
                instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any
                other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The
                Guarantors waive, to the extent permitted by Law, any and all notice of the
                creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the
                Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon
                this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and
                any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or
                incurred in reliance upon this Guaranty, and all dealings between the Borrower and
                the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or
                consummated in reliance upon this Guaranty. This Guaranty shall be construed as a
                continuing, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without
                regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time
                or from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of
                the Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by
                the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against
                the Borrower or against any other person which may be or become liable in respect of
                all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or
                guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. This Guaranty shall
                remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent
                of its terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall
                inure to the benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors and assigns,
                notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there may
                be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding.</p>
            <p>Section 11.03. Reinstatement</p>
            <p>280</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article 11 shall be automatically
                reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of
                the Borrower or other Loan Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is
                rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed
                Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in insolvency, bankruptcy or
                reorganization or otherwise.</p>
            <p>Section 11.04. Subrogation; Subordination</p>
            <p>. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full in
                cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge
                Agreements and Treasury Services Agreements not yet due and payable and (y)
                contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued and payable) and the
                expiration or termination of the Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement, it
                shall waive any claim and shall not exercise any right or remedy, direct or
                indirect, arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in ‎Section
                11.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise, against the Borrower or any other
                Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the
                Guaranteed Obligations. Any Indebtedness of any Loan Party permitted pursuant to
                Sections ‎7.03(b)(ii) or ‎7.03(d) shall be subordinated to such Loan Party’s
                Obligations in the manner set forth in the Intercompany Note evidencing such
                Indebtedness.</p>
            <p>Section 11.05. Remedies</p>
            <p>. The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Guarantors and the
                Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, if any,
                may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in ‎Section 8.02 (and
                shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances
                provided in ‎Section 8.02) for purposes of ‎Section 11.01, notwithstanding any stay,
                injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations
                from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in
                the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
                automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by
                the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes
                of ‎Section 11.01.</p>
            <p>Section 11.06. Instrument for the Payment of Money</p>
            <p>. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article 11
                constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any
                Lender or Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in
                the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a
                motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.</p>
            <p>Section 11.07. Continuing Guaranty</p>
            <p>. The guarantee in this Article 11 is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall
                apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.</p>
            <p>Section 11.08. General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations</p>
            <p>281</p>
            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate, limited partnership or
                limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign
                bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Law affecting the rights of
                creditors generally, if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under ‎Section
                11.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
                unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of
                the amount of its liability under ‎Section 11.01, then, notwithstanding any other
                provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further
                action by such Subsidiary Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other person, be
                automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the
                right of contribution established in ‎Section 11.11) that is valid and enforceable
                and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action
                or proceeding.</p>
            <p>Section 11.09. Information</p>
            <p>. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of
                the Borrower’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances
                bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature,
                scope and extent of the risks that each Guarantor assumes and incurs under this
                Guaranty, and agrees that none of any Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender shall have
                any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to it regarding those
                circumstances or risks.</p>
            <p>Section 11.10. Release of Guarantors</p>
            <p>. If, in compliance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, (i) all or
                substantially all of the Equity Interests or property of any Subsidiary Guarantor
                are sold or otherwise transferred as permitted under this Agreement, to a person or
                persons, none of which is a Loan Party or (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an
                Excluded Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall, upon the consummation of such
                sale or transfer or upon becoming an Excluded Subsidiary, be automatically released
                from its obligations under this Agreement (including under ‎Section 10.05 hereof)
                and its obligations to pledge and grant any Collateral owned by it pursuant to any
                Collateral Document and the pledge of such Equity Interests to the Collateral Agent
                pursuant to the Collateral Documents shall be automatically released, and, so long
                as the Borrower shall have provided the Agents such certifications or documents as
                any Agent shall reasonably request, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
                Agent shall, at such Subsidiary Guarantor’s expense, take such actions as are
                necessary to effect each release described in this ‎Section 11.10 in accordance with
                the relevant provisions of the Collateral Documents; provided that no such release
                shall occur if such Guarantor continues to be a guarantor in respect of the Senior
                Notes or any Junior Financing with a principal amount in excess of the Threshold
                Amount.</p>
            <p>When all Commitments hereunder have terminated, and all Loans or other Obligations
                (other than obligations under Treasury Services Agreements or Secured Hedge
                Agreements) hereunder which are accrued and payable have been paid or satisfied, and
                no Letter of Credit remains outstanding (except any Letter of Credit the Outstanding
                Amount of which the Obligations related thereto has been Cash Collateralized or for
                which a backstop letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C
                Issuer has been put in place), this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
                guarantees made herein shall</p>

            <p rend="First Paragraph"> </p>
            <p>terminate with respect to all Obligations, except with respect to Obligations that
                expressly survive such repayment pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
                other Loan Documents. The Collateral Agent shall, at each Guarantor’s expense, take
                such actions as are necessary to release any Collateral owned by such Guarantor in
                accordance with the relevant provisions of the Collateral Documents.</p>
            <p>Section 11.11. Right of Contribution</p>
            <p>. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Subsidiary Guarantor shall
                have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such
                Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and
                against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of
                such payment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor’s right of contribution shall be subject to
                the terms and conditions of ‎Section 11.04. The provisions of this ‎Section 11.11
                shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Subsidiary
                Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender and the
                Lenders, and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative
                Agent, the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders for the full amount
                guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.</p>
            <p>Section 11.12. Cross-Guaranty</p>
            <p>. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, absolutely,
                unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to
                each Specified Guarantor as may be needed by such Specified Guarantor from time to
                time to honor all of its obligations under its Guaranty and the other Loan Documents
                in respect of any Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP
                Guarantor shall only be liable under this ‎Section 11.12 for up to the maximum
                amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such
                Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this ‎Section 11.12
                voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
                transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each
                Qualified ECP Guarantor under this ‎Section 11.12 shall remain in full force and
                effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and
                all Commitments have been terminated. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this
                ‎Section 11.12 constitute, and this ‎Section 11.12 shall be deemed to constitute, an
                agreement for the benefit of each Specified Guarantor for all purposes of the
                Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
