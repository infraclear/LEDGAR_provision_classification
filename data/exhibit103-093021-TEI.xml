Taxes.</p><p>(a)Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Transaction Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower, Servicer, Administrative Agent or Group Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment to an Affected Person, then the Borrower, Servicer, Administrative Agent or Group Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the applicable Affected Person receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.</p><p>(b)Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by an Affected Person (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of an Affected Person, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.</p><p>(d)Indemnification by the Lenders.

Neither the Borrower on the one hand, nor any other PG&amp;E Party or any Affiliate thereof, on the other hand, will be or will hold itself out to be responsible for the debts of the other or the decisions or actions respecting the daily business and affairs of the other. Each PG&amp;E Party and their respective Affiliates will immediately correct any known misrepresentation with respect to the foregoing, and they will not operate or purport to operate as an integrated single economic unit with respect to each other or in their dealing with any other entity.</p><p>(q)Allocation of Overhead. To the extent that Borrower, on the one hand, and each of the other PG&amp;E Parties or any Affiliate thereof, on the other hand, have offices in the same location, there shall be a fair and appropriate allocation of overhead costs between them, and the Borrower shall bear its fair share of such expenses, which may be paid through the Servicing Fee or otherwise.</p><p>ARTICLE VIII<lb/><lb/>ADMINISTRATION AND COLLECTION<lb/>OF RECEIVABLES</p><p>SECTION VIII.01.

In addition, an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender (x) shall be reduced by the proceeds of prepayments or repayments of principal and interest, or other distribution in respect of principal and interest, received by the Administrative Agent on or with respect to any such Loans acquired from such Lender pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment (to the extent that any such Loans are then owned by the Administrative Agent) and (y) may, in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent, be reduced by any amount specified by the Administrative Agent in writing to the applicable Lender from time to time.</p><p>(e)The parties hereto agree that (x) irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, in the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights and interests of such Payment Recipient (and, in the case of any Payment Recipient who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, Group Agent or Secured Party, to the rights and interests of such</p><p>Lender, Group Agent or Secured Party, as the case may be) under the Transaction Documents with respect to such amount (the “Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights”) (provided that the Borrower’s Borrower Obligations under the Transaction Documents in respect of the Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights shall not be duplicative of such Borrower Obligations in respect of Loans that have been assigned to the Administrative Agent under an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment) and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Borrower Obligations owed by the Borrower; provided that this Section 10.10 shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Borrower Obligations relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Borrower Obligations that would have been payable had such Erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent; provided, further, that for the avoidance of doubt, immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y) shall not apply to the extent any such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.</p><p>(f)To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including, without limitation, any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.</p><p>(g)Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 10.10 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or Group Agent, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Borrower Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Transaction Document.</p><p>ARTICLE XI<lb/><lb/>THE GROUP AGENTS</p><p>SECTION XI.01. Authorization and Action. Each Credit Party that belongs to a Group hereby appoints and authorizes the Group Agent for such Group to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to such Group Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. No Group Agent shall have any duties other than those expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents, and no implied obligations or liabilities shall be read into any Transaction Document, or otherwise exist, against any Group Agent. No Group Agent assumes, nor shall it be deemed to have assumed, any obligation to, or relationship of trust or agency with the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, any Lender except for any obligations expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, in no event shall any Group Agent ever be required to take any action which exposes such Group Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to any provision of any Transaction Document or Applicable Law.</p><p>SECTION XI.02. Group Agent’s Reliance, Etc. No Group Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them as a Group Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents in the absence of its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Group Agent: (a) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the Servicer), independent certified public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (b) makes no warranty or representation to any Credit Party (whether written or oral) and shall not be responsible to any Credit Party for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made by any other party in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; (c) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document on the part of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof or any other Person or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof; (d) shall not be responsible to any Credit Party for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Transaction Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (e) shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in so relying, upon any notice (including notice by telephone), consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.</p><p>SECTION XI.03. Group Agent and Affiliates. With respect to any Credit Extension or interests therein owned by any Credit Party that is also a Group Agent, such Credit Party shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not a Group Agent. A Group Agent and any of its Affiliates may generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof or any of their respective Affiliates, all as if such Group Agent were not a Group Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to any other Secured Party.</p><p>SECTION XI.04. Indemnification of Group Agents. Each Committed Lender in any Group agrees to indemnify the Group Agent for such Group (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof), ratably according to the proportion of the Percentage of such Committed Lender to the aggregate Percentages of all Committed Lenders in such Group, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Group Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any action taken or omitted by such Group Agent under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; provided that no Committed Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Group Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p><p>SECTION XI.05. Delegation of Duties. Each Group Agent may execute any of its duties through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. No Group Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.</p><p>SECTION XI.06. Notice of Events of Default or Termination Events. No Group Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Event of Default, Event of Default, Unmatured Termination Event or Termination Event unless such Group Agent has received notice from the Administrative Agent, any other Group Agent, any other Credit Party, the Servicer or the Borrower stating that an Unmatured Event of Default, an Event of Default, an Unmatured Termination Event or a Termination Event has occurred hereunder and describing such Unmatured Event of Default, Event of Default, Unmatured Termination Event or Termination Event. If a Group Agent receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to the Credit Parties in its Group and to the Administrative Agent (but only if such notice received by such Group Agent was not sent by the Administrative Agent). A Group Agent may take such action concerning an Unmatured Event of Default, an Event of Default, an Unmatured Termination Event or a Termination Event as may be directed by Committed Lenders in its Group representing a majority of the Commitments in such Group (subject to the other provisions of this Article XI), but until such Group Agent receives such directions, such Group Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as such Group Agent deems advisable and in the best interests of the Conduit Lenders and Committed Lenders in its Group.</p><p>SECTION XI.07. Non-Reliance on Group Agent and Other Parties. Each Credit Party expressly acknowledges that neither the Group Agent for its Group nor any of such Group Agent’s directors, officers, agents or employees has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by such Group Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Group Agent. Each Credit Party represents and warrants to the Group Agent for its Group that, independently and without reliance upon such Group Agent, any other Group Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Party and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, it has made and will continue to make its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof and the Receivables and its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to take, or omit, action under any Transaction Document. Except for items expressly required to be delivered under any Transaction Document by a Group Agent to any Credit Party in its Group, no Group Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Credit Party in its Group with any information concerning the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof that comes into the possession of such Group Agent or any of its directors, officers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.</p><p>SECTION XI.08. Successor Group Agent. Any Group Agent may, upon at least thirty (30) days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Servicer and the Credit Parties in its Group, resign as Group Agent for its Group. Such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Group Agent is appointed by the Lender(s) in such Group. Upon such acceptance of its appointment as Group Agent for such Group hereunder by a successor Group</p><p>Agent, such successor Group Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the resigning Group Agent, and the resigning Group Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents. After any resigning Group Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article XI and Article XII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was a Group Agent.</p><p>SECTION XI.09. Reliance on Group Agent. Unless otherwise advised in writing by a Group Agent or by any Credit Party in such Group Agent’s Group, each party to this Agreement may assume that (i) such Group Agent is acting for the benefit and on behalf of each of the Credit Parties in its Group, as well as for the benefit of each assignee or other transferee from any such Person and (ii) each action taken by such Group Agent has been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action on the part of the Credit Parties in its Group.</p><p>ARTICLE XII<lb/><lb/>INDEMNIFICATION</p><p>SECTION XII.01. Indemnification by the Borrower.</p><p>(a)Without limiting any other rights that the Administrative Agent, the Credit Parties, the Affected Persons and their respective assigns, officers, directors, agents and employees (each, a “Borrower Indemnified Party”) may have hereunder or under Applicable Law, the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Borrower Indemnified Party from and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities (including Attorney Costs) (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as “Borrower Indemnified Amounts”) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the use of proceeds of the Credit Extensions or the security interest in respect of any Pool Receivable or any other Collateral; excluding, however, (a) Borrower Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that such Borrower Indemnified Amounts resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct by such Borrower Indemnified Party seeking indemnification and (b) Taxes that are covered by Section 4.03 (other than Taxes specifically enumerated below and Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim).

The Administrative Agent shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain at its address referred to on Schedule III of this Agreement (or such other address of the Administrative Agent notified by the Administrative Agent to the other parties hereto) a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Committed Lenders and the Conduit Lenders, the Commitment of each Committed Lender and the aggregate outstanding Capital (and stated interest) of the Loans of each Conduit Lender and Committed Lender from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Servicer, the Administrative Agent, the Group Agents, and the other Credit Parties shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as a Committed Lender or Conduit Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement.

Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed and delivered by an assigning Committed Lender and an Eligible Assignee or assignee Committed Lender, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance</p><p>Agreement has been duly completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Servicer.</p><p>(e)Participations. Each Committed Lender may sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, a “Participant”) in or to all or a portion of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment and the interests in the Loans owned by it); provided, however, that</p><p>(i)such Committed Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, and</p><p>(ii)such Committed Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to this Agreement for the performance of such obligations.</p><p>The Administrative Agent, the Group Agents, the Conduit Lenders, the other Committed Lenders, the Borrower and the Servicer shall have the right to continue to deal solely and directly with such Committed Lender in connection with such Committed Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.01 and 4.03 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 4.03(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 4.03(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.01 or 4.03, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.</p><p>(f)Participant Register. Each Committed Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Committed Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any this Agreement) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Committed Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.</p><p>(g)Assignments by Agents. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent herein shall be assignable by the Administrative</p><p>Agent or such Group Agent, as the case may be, and its successors and assigns; provided that in the case of an assignment to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or such Group Agent, so long as no Event of Default, Unmatured Event of Default, Termination Event or Unmatured Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, such assignment shall require the Borrower’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).</p><p>(h)Assignments by the Borrower or the Servicer. Neither the Borrower nor, except as provided in Section 8.01, the Servicer may assign any of its respective rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent (such consent to be provided or withheld in the sole discretion of such Person).</p><p>(i)Pledge to a Federal Reserve Bank.
