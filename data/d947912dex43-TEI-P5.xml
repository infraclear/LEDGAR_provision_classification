            <p><hi style="font-size:10pt" xml:space="preserve">This Senior Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the Company, issued and issuable in one or more series under an Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of April 22, 2005 (the “Base Indenture”), as previously supplemented and as further supplemented by a Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 21, 2014, and as amended by the Thirtieth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2020 (as so amended and supplemented, and together with all additional indentures supplemental thereto, and any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular Bonds, being herein called the “Indenture”), between the Company and BOKF, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the “Trustee,” which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Bonds thereunder and of the terms and conditions upon which Bonds are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Senior Note is a Bond within the meaning of the Indenture and is one of the Bonds of the forty-fourth series designated as the 4.75% Senior Notes due February 15, 2044 established by the Company under the Indenture and initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $450,000,000 on February 21, 2014. As a result of the further issuance of $225,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the forty-fourth series on August 18, 2014, the issued amount of Bonds of such series now totals $675,000,000. The acceptance of this Senior Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. </hi></p>

This Senior Note is a Bond within the meaning of the Indenture and is one of the Bonds of the forty-sixth series designated as the 3.40% Senior Notes due August 15, 2024 established by the Company under the Indenture. The acceptance of this Senior Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. </hi></p>

If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Senior Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent or the Trustee on or prior to the Redemption Date, from and after such Redemption Date such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall cease to bear interest.

This Senior Note is a Bond within the meaning of the Indenture and is one of the Bonds of the forty-seventh series designated as the 4.30% Senior Notes due March 15, 2045 established by the Company under the Indenture. The acceptance of this Senior Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. </hi></p>
            <p><hi style="font-size:10pt" xml:space="preserve">The Senior Notes will be secured by a series of first mortgage bonds (the “4.30% Collateral Mortgage Bonds due 2045”) delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes, issued pursuant to the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2020 to the Indenture of Mortgage, dated as of June 19, 2020, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (as so supplemented, the “Mortgage Indenture”). Reference is made to the Indenture and the Mortgage Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the 4.30% Collateral Mortgage Bonds due 2045, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and rights of the holders of the first mortgage bonds under the Mortgage Indenture and the rights of the Company under the Mortgage Indenture and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Notes are secured. </hi></p>

If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Senior Notes (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent or the Trustee on or prior to the Redemption Date, from and after such Redemption Date such Senior Notes or portions thereof shall cease to bear interest.

As a result of the further issuance of $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the forty-seventh series on June 12, 2015, the issued amount of Bonds of such series now totals $600,000,000.

This Senior Note is a Bond within the meaning of the Indenture and is one of the Bonds of the fifty-second series designated as the 4.00% Senior Notes due December 1, 2046 established by the Company under the Indenture and initially issued in an aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 on December 1, 2016. As a result of the further issuance of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the fifty-second series on March 10, 2017, the issued amount of Bonds of such series now totals $600,000,000. The acceptance of this Senior Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture. </hi></p>
